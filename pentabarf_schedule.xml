Human rights and Internet Freedom work isn&#8217;t exempt from the very injustices that we fight against. Being from the &#8220;global north,&#8221; having white skin, being cisgender, able-bodied, and male&#8230;.these privileges and more are at play in our community. In the current political climate it&#8217;s more urgent than ever that we address these problems- and &#8220;we&#8221; need to not rely on labor from affected people.

This is starting to happen. Women and nonbinary people have watched with approval the few men in our field who have put their name on pledges not to speak on &#8220;manels&#8221;- all-male panels. Codes of conduct that acknowledge the very real problem of sexual harassment are slowly becoming the norm. And travel assistance for big conferences has enabled some to attend who otherwise would not be there. 

But that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg.  There&#8217;s a bigger conversation about these issues that is happening behind closed doors, and you might not be a part of it- with good reason. If you&#8217;re not addressing these issues head on, you might be perpetuating them. And &#8220;you&#8221; might not be a cis white male. It&#8217;s not just about manels. It&#8217;s about skin color, income, and country. A queer woman from the US with an advanced degree. or a cis, straight person of color from Europe can still experience a lot of privilege.. There are any number of ways in which some members of our community are privileged, have more access to resources, and are taken more seriously.

But the good news is, there is something we can do. 

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the ways in which we recurringly see privilege exert itself in our community, from not addressing sexual assault to treating people from the "Global South" as extractable resources rather than experts that deserve respect. Workshop leaders will lay the ground for the discussion by talking about some examples. The goal of the workshop is to start coming up with a set of principles- some of which already exist, such as &#8220;don&#8217;t speak on all-men panels&#8221;- that is similar to a code of conduct and that will help individuals, organizations, and event planners do better. 
This session is for anyone who wants to talk about addressing injustices in our own community, but it is especially for white people. I will write a very clear description of the goals and expectations should it be accepted. I hope to get more white people from the US and Europe understanding and addressing these issues, and maybe even form a core anti-oppression collective that works together outside of conferences. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/388</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="0">Dia Kayyali</person></persons></event><event id="1"><date>2018-03-05T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Attic</duration><track>Journalism, Media and Communications</track><abstract /><title>Online harassment: smear campaigns against Honduran journalists and human rights defenders on facebook</title><description>At the beginning participants will be asked to review under their chairs, all will have threatening messages (taken from real examples) addressed to them, participants will be invited to express how they feel and would do in that case.

A dialogue between service providers and users on the future of autonomous infrastructure</title><description>Do you use the internet? You know, the one that profits from your data, leaks it to hackers, and then turns it over to repressive governments? What would it look like to build feminist, movement-led services designed to actually meet your needs?

Join us for an open a dialogue concerning the direction that alternative service should take. Dozens of alternative providers have started to come together to work on the future of digital infrastructure and we want your experience to help guide our efforts.

In this session, users and service providers will share stories and knowledge as we tackle the following questions:

* Imagining the ideal: What needs, work flows, and features are most important? What should relationships between service provider and user look like?

* Storytelling: How do we talk about the value of self-determination, of feminism, of decolonization when it comes to the cloud services we use?

* Security: What is confusing or keeps you up at night? What should we prioritize in order to keep you and your community safe?This session is for everyone who wants an internet that is based on solidarity, community, and security. Help independent service providers write their next chapter, one based on your needs and founded on digital justice.This dialog are part of an ongoing process. In concert with similar events elsewhere, the notes generated at IFF will be used to guide the future planning and software development of a new infrastructure project comprised of a dozen independent service providers. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/569</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="2">elijah</person></persons></event><event id="3"><date>2018-03-05T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Gallery</duration><track>Making Better Tech</track><abstract /><title>Against stalkerware: building public awareness and consent technology</title><description>This will be a two hour conversation about our research regarding stalkerware technology. Through our research we are creating a landscape overview about the issue of stalkerware and how it has grown in the last couple of years. Stalkerware not only impacts individuals within an intimate partner relationship but also family situations. The main issue with stalkerware is the violation of privacy, individuals are not consenting to being surveilled. It is important to build consentful technology but what does that look like within this space?This session will be collaborative, building upon our research and expanding it to build public awareness alongside support for individuals facing these experiences. This session is for everyone especially individuals who work with civil society organizations, as we want to support them the best we can.We hope that individuals leave the session learning something new about the topic. We also want to build collaboratively with others as we try our best to build public awareness about the issue. People will leave the session also learning more about consent technology, and ways we can build stronger products and processes within a community. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/593</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="3">Nasma Ahmed</person></persons></event></room><room name="Think Tank"><event id="4"><date>2018-03-05T15:45:00</date><start>15:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>Training and Best Practices</track><abstract /><title>Communications in clandestine situations</title><description>The Venezuelan Government&#8217;s repression and the persecution of activists and opposition in general has increased considerably since last April, when a new wave of protests against the regime began. This situation meant that a significant number of political and social leaders, such as the mayor of the municipality El Hatillo, David Smolansky or the vice president of the National Assembly, Freddy Guevara, had to go into hiding.

Faced with this fact, a group of Venezuelan trainers carried out a communications protocol for clandestine situations. This protocol indicates everything a user must do from the acquisition of the equipment, through its configuration and use, to establish a secure communication channel with third parties during isolation or eventual departure from the country.

During this session we want to share this protocol and the implementation experience,and receive their impressions to improve upon it.Security trainers, journalists, communications professionals and developers of support material for trainers.- Impressions of the attendees about the clandestine protocol

This will be through the presentation of a three country research which was done as a part of the Exploratory Research into Information and Communications Technology and Sexuality (EROTICS) South Asia network by three member organisations in Nepal, Sri Lanka, and India.

The India research does an in-depth exploration of one section of India's Information Technology Act: Section 67, more commonly known as the anti-obscenity provision, through mixed methodology including quantitative data and media reports on cases under Section 67 from three years, and suggests recommendations to make the law more rights-affirming.
The Sri Lanka research examines the way in which LGBT Sri Lankan&#8217;s exercise their rights in the online space through available internet platforms and other services as well as the existing legal and policy framework that shrouds the online space in Sri Lanka. The findings also look at the limitations and restrictions which impede usage of the internet by queer Sri Lankans and policy reforms which can change this.
The Nepal research explores the relation between the use of internet and freedom of expression, particularly sexuality, and examines how the internet is practiced by women&#8217;s rights and LGBTQI activists in Nepal. It further navigates to identify opportunities for engagement and advocacy, based on the belief that the internet plays a pivotal role in fulfillment of sexual rights.Gender and sexuality rights activists, queer persons and activists, lawyers and legal rights activists, digital rights activists, policy makers, intermediaries, advocacy people, researchers who look at law through a feminist lens.Through this session, we want people to think more indepthly about the intersection of freedom and resistance on sex, rights and the internet in South Asia. We also want to provoke discussions on how laws dealing with &#8216;obscenity&#8217; or anything sex and sexuality related is used to silence dissent and impede on freedom of expression.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/466</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="5">Smita</person></persons></event><event id="6"><date>2018-03-05T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>Advocacy, Policy and Research</track><abstract /><title>How you can get involved in shaping the future of the internet - make an impact, and have fun while doing it!</title><description>Most of us are skilled at using the Internet, but few know how, as an end-user of the Internet, we can make an impact in Internet policy and shape its future evolution. 

This session brings together in conversation various Internet governance experts -- some with a junior profile, others with several years of experience -- to speak about their pathways to engagement in Internet governance. 

The conversation begins with an introduction to the work of ICANN and the Domain Name System (DNS). We will also cover why it is important that civil society and individual end-users participate in the shaping of these policies. 

The conversation then turns to the different positions taken by the various stakeholder groups and how they can be influenced by various factors, before examining the different resources -- of mentorship, of capacity building, of travel support -- that are available to make the participation of new voices in DNS policy a reality. 

We conclude on a practical note, explaining how you can get involved now in the DNS policy issues that you care about. We will give some practical pointers on how you can get involved, see the multistakeholder model in action, and fight for change.If you have strong positions on issues like privacy and data protection, human rights online, economic growth, and development for empowerment, and increasing access to knowledge, but don&#8217;t know how to translate this to Internet governance debates, come to this session and learn how getting involved in Domain Name System policy could be one avenue where you can contribute your ideas and knowledge, make a difference, and have fun in the process.- Participants will leave this conversation understanding a pragmatic and attainable pathway to engagement in Internet policy.
- Participants will discover what communities, working groups, and comment opportunities are out there in the various Internet policy making fora.
- During the session, a collaborative pad will be created, collating relevant Internet policy making resources which you can use -- and share with your friends and colleagues -- to jump start your own efforts in shaping policy.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/76</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="6">ferdeline</person></persons></event></room><room name="Theater"><event id="7"><date>2018-03-05T14:30:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Theater</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>The digital rights space: portrait of a social movement</title><description>I have been conducting research for my PhD dissertation, (&#8220;Use Signal, Use Tor&#8221;?

As I complete my project I am eager to reflect what I have learned back to the community and seek IFF attendees&#8217; feedback on my work. At the 2018 IFF I hope to present my dissertation chapter that looks at the digital rights space as a transnational social movement with roots in both the international human rights movement and in cypherpunk discourses. Other themes include the relationship between the digital rights space and the US internet freedom agenda; tensions over gender and sexual violence in the space; creating a safe, inclusive movement for all; where I see the space going from here. In keeping with participatory research principles, I plan to both share my research and seek feedback from the community.newcomers to the digital rights space; anyone who wants to understand the digital rights space and where it&#8217;s going; the dozens of IFF community members who have contributed to my research since 2015; researchers.Receive feedback on my work-in-progress from the community; encourage reflection on where we&#8217;ve come from, where we are now, where we&#8217;re going, and how we&#8217;re going to get there.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/195</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="7">Nathalie M</person></persons></event><event id="8"><date>2018-03-05T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Theater</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>Internet freedom in southeast Asia: challenges and ways forward</title><description>This panel will gather digital rights activists from Southeast Asia to map out challenges and ways forward for internet freedom in the region.

the LGBT community is a community that is targeted in Africa and beyond. This community relies on social media to do all sorts of things e.g campaigns, conversations, and educating of the general public on issues of the "so" named community. 
looking especially at the transgender community. as a trans* person i feel that we are not safe when it comes to internet and social media. We are putting our lives (personal and private) out there so it is where we feel we can air our views on what people say about the community. but we don't realize we are putting our lives at risk by doing so.Technologists, Trans* community, designers and communications professionals and journalists.Educating people on the advantages and disadvantages of internet specifically social media sites.

We will analyze how to safeguard our freedoms in the network - to express, to inform, to access to all kinds of content; and on the other hand - how to guarantee our right to privacy and intimacy without this granting private companies and governments the power to censor and transgress the neutrality of the network.

We will examine these discourses, which sometimes over simplify the issue and are enunciated from a white-cis-masculine privilege. This is why we seek to generate or enunciate a series of arguments or "counter-arguments" about the need to eliminate or modify certain content of the network, or at least to trigger the need to have a debate about it; taking into account our backgrounds, the specificity of our contexts, and our feminist perspectives.Cyber-feminists, journalists, activists, and human rights defenders in general.We will systematize the outcomes of the discussion in a fanzine/brochure, tentatively following these questions:

&gt; Key technical concepts to understand what we are talking about when we talk about the right to be forgotten (is to de-index? Delete? Hide information? How does a search engine work?)

&gt; From a privacy and digital security stand: what technical features do we imagine that could facilitate the interaction between those who publish information and the people subject of that information?

&gt; What roles we want (or we don't want) private corporations, governments, and virtual/hacktivist communities to play in relation to the right to be forgotten?</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/305</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="11">fumiko</person></persons></event><event id="12"><date>2018-03-05T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Flyover Front</duration><track>Advocacy, Policy and Research</track><abstract /><title>Public money - public infrastructure - public code</title><description>Why is research financed with taxpayers' money not released as Open Access? Why are educational resources created using public money not Open Educational Resources? Why is software developed using public money not released as Free Software? 

It is a shame that public money does not yet produce public knowledge but at least the conditions get better and better. While in 2000 hardly any politician even knew what the Internet is, in 2017 many young and new elected politicians already know what a free license is. And even more intuitively understand the demand that public money should create public infrastructure / knowledge. 

With the Free Software Foundation Europe we are currently running a successful campaign that demands for public code. The time seems ripe for this demand.

We like to share some experience and insights about the campaign and invite you to participate, adopt or even extend the demand into other areas like Open Access, Open Educational Resources or similar. Let's partner up and try to get "public money - public knowledge" as a framework for various activities during the electoral campaigns for the European elections 2019.

Based on Datos Protegidos own research and the expertise gained in the last years, we identify some common trends and tools that we can leverage through a community of legal privacy practitioners, mainly in Latin America but applicable to other regions. Among those tools are public information requests, data subject access requests; data protection, consumer, criminal and constitutional litigation; and regional human rights tools.
In the session, Datos Protegidos will discuss about these different tools, presenting a webpage related with that project and fostering their proposal for regional privacy litigation hubs, while Privacy International will present their litigation work on surveillance, and explore collaboration avenues with other participant organizations, to help them navigate the EU/UK/USA legal framework to request relevant information or intervene in relevant cases.
- People with legal background and experience, either in national legislations or human rights systems.
- Skilled lawyers and technologists looking for new ways to access and enforce data protection issues.
- Organizations interested on the articulation of networks of legal practitioners interested in sharing their challenges and experiences.
- Activists interested in building a robust and comprehensive concept of privacy, and moving forward to an express recognition of rights connected with digital era.
- Learn and discuss about legal tools available to litigate privacy rights, using the presenters&#8217; experience as a starting point.
- Explore collaboration avenues between organizations interested on privacy litigation.
- Discuss a proposal, previously presented in LAVITS 2017 in Chile, to build such formal collaboration mechanisms. 
-Present the commitments made by the organizations in a web platform.
-Open the space to other actors.

It is the practice of releasing negative energy and experiences, letting them lie where they belong- without detaching from the person who was involved in these situations. In allowing the negative experiences to dissipate- you are free to act with and from acceptance, love, and compassion. Detachment is not the act of leaving a person behind- but instead- of detaching from the pain of involvement. Rational detachment increases rational reactions &#8211; positive emotions- and ultimately decreases the rate of burnout. All members of the Internet Freedom Community would positively benefit from learning rational detachment skills. Detachment is not just a skill to be used in our 'work', it is frequently used in personal/social situations. Short-term, I would like for those who participate in the session to feel empowered in taking on difficult/stressful situations, knowing they have more tools in their toolbox to positively cope. Long-term, I expect to see a decrease in burnout symptoms from participants in this session.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/667</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="16">Emily G</person></persons></event><event id="17"><date>2018-03-05T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>La Factoria</duration><track>On the Frontlines</track><abstract /><title>From Muslim Ban to Black Identity Extremism What is the Way Forward?</title><description>The landscape of Internet Freedom in the US has changed drastically with the attacks on minorities under the Trump Administration. from the Muslim Ban, to the collection of Social Media Identities, to the new FBI Black Identity Extremist category for Black Lives Matters, and the rise of White Supremacist Digital Vigilantism.

In April 2013, a statutory board under Singapore&#8217;s ministry of education threatened to sue me for defamation, I was 21 years old when I received the letter of demand that wanted to silence my freedom of speech.

After which, the Singapore government amended the Sedition Act (CHAPTER 290) on 31 August 2013 and Defamation Act (CHAPTER 75) on 28 February 2014.

In 2014, my supporters and I were harassed by Singapore&#8217;s police with very late night visits to our homes and long interviews without any meal in the police station.
I underwent a total of 8 hours at the police station from 2pm till 8pm for interrogation by the police, was denied of legal assistance and had my paper notebook that was used to take down notes being seized from me.

After which, the Singapore government implemented the Protection from Harassment Act (CHAPTER 256A) on 31 May 2015.

In 2015, 5 other Singaporeans and I were charged for public nuisance and illegal assembly for organising an event with regards to Singapore&#8217;s pension fund.
I was 23 years old when the Singapore government used 4 deputy public prosecutors to charge us - we had no legal representation.

After which, the Singapore government amended the Public Order Act (CHAPTER 257A) on 8 May 2016 and implemented the Administration of Justice (Protection) Bill on 11 July 2016.

In 2016, I was disqualified from Singapore&#8217;s general election as Singapore&#8217;s judge Chay Yuen Fatt fined me - a total of SGD$3,100 over the #ReturnOurCPF #&#36824;&#25105;&#20204;&#20844;&#31215;&#37329; event held on 27 Sep 2014 which attracted more than 6,000 Singaporeans.

As of 2017, the Singapore government is planning to pass a bill in parliament and make it an offence for event organisers if they fail to notify the police when their event has a crowd size of above 5,000 people.
Front-line activists to learn from each other regarding the new laws being implemented.
Tech people to share how we can overcome surveillance and obstacles.Freedom of speech is greatly limited in Singapore. I was threatened with defamation suit in 2013 when questioning the government&#8217;s education system. In 2014, bloggers were either being sued for defamation by Singapore&#8217;s prime minister or charged for contempt of court. I hope to be able to learn about the situation in other countries and how people campaign for free speech. 

Freedom of assembly is restricted to only the speakers&#8217; corner in Singapore. I was being charged for public nuisance and illegal assembly in 2014 when I was organising event with regards to Singapore&#8217;s pension fund. Prior to that, my team and I have been holding event on Singapore&#8217;s public transport, Singapore&#8217;s public housing, Singapore&#8217;s public healthcare and the crowd size was increasing. I hope to be able to learn about how activists in other countries educate the public on their rights to the freedom of assembly. 

Rights to parliamentary election is limited to the wealthy in Singapore due to a high election deposit cost. I was the first female who took part in Singapore&#8217;s election as an independent candidate and managed to break the single-digit percentage that was secured in the past. Being the youngest person who took part in Singapore&#8217;s latest general election, I hope to be able to learn about the campaigns in other countries as well as how to get the youth and females more involved in policy making.

This session is one of several conversations to inform the development of a curriculum and research agenda that will provide current and future policy makers and public leaders with the means to think critically about the implications for human rights with the use of digital technologies.

It has historically functioned as an oppressive tool to control women&#8217;s bodies, and other bodies which do not fit into the binary of male and female, as well as their speech and activism. With the advent of technology and its spread into everyday lives, technological surveillance is now integrated with structural surveillance. Needless to say, the data and metadata collected through surveillance are not neutral with respect to gender, sexuality, caste, class, religion or race.

With the offline power structures being replicated online, and data being power, it is important to see who is controlling and exercising this power. Women, gender non-conforming and queer persons are the once most affected within this new system of power. This session aims to explore the points of intersection of gender and sexuality, with big data and surveillance. 

How does data-based surveillance affect women&#8217;s sexual and reproductive health rights in the global south? What does it mean to be queer and have your phone number linked to a weakly protected government mass surveillance system in India? How can we counter an internet which is increasingly being constructed by prejudice-influenced metadata collected from the powerful, and learnt and replicated by machines? What can we do to break the chilling effect caused by mass surveillance on freedom of speech and expression? In global south economies where sexuality is already taboo and surveillance is widely accepted, how do we even meaningfully begin these conversations? These are some of the questions which will be discussed at this session through discussions between various activists and researchers from different parts of the world.
Women's and gender rights activists, queer rights activists, digital rights activists, civil society organisations, researchers working on gender and sexuality, sexual and reproductive health practitioners and advocates
Increased understanding on how big data is collected, stored and used by different stakeholders, and how this particularly influences conversations around gender and sexuality, and affects women and queer persons. On the other hand, it will also show how data is not neutral, but is influenced by existing prevalent ideas of gender and sexuality.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/454</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="20">Smita</person></persons></event><event id="21"><date>2018-03-08T14:30:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>2:00</duration><duration>Attic</duration><track>Journalism, Media and Communications</track><abstract /><title>Reporter in danger - surveillance defense simulation game</title><description>This workshop is a simulation game where the attendants will deal with different situations involving journalists and human rights defenders under surveillance.

Some information &#8212;&#160;leaked documents, signing keys, master passwords, documentary footage &#8212;&#160;is of too great import to be stewarded by a single individual. Sunder is a computer application that allows a group to encrypt sensitive content and split the key into a desired number of fragments, a predetermined subset of which are required to decrypt the content when it is finally called up to be recovered. By alleviating the risks of physical coercion, device compromise, and human error, this tool has wide-reaching applications for news organizations and media makers wishing to retain access control to documentary footage, massive datasets, troves of documents, and valuable audio recordings.

These groups of users are often targeted with phishing attacks, exploited by data breach due to physical compromises (arrest of associates) and targeted by the growing phenomenon of government-sponsored trolls. Language then becomes a huge issue when the activist has to reach out for help. Many great help desks and emergency response systems exist but they are often only available in English or serviced by people who may not understand the local context. 

Since 2010, Viet Tan&#8217;s Help Desk personnel have offered technical support to hundreds of activists and personally responded to questions, troubleshoot and other referrals in cases of digital attacks or compromised online accounts. Collaborating with other Help Desk services, Viet Tan&#8217;s Helpdesk acts as an local intermediary to vet and communicate with casework that originate from Vietnam. We've learned to localize not only ethos and infrastructure of larger help desks but localize the process and methodology to suit the local context. We want to bring the community in a larger discussion on how this can be replicated more widely in other regions.Technologists, advocacy/policy professionals, security trainersA network of support for those who are looking to localizing a help desk; a common understanding of best practices.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/679</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="23">trinhi</person></persons></event><event id="24"><date>2018-03-08T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Gallery</duration><track>Making Better Tech</track><abstract /><title>Creating secure, anonymous, and distributed platforms for personal audiovisual archives</title><description>People armed with mobile devices are becoming history&#8217;s first responders, amassing rich, contextualized, and crucial records of today&#8217;s breaking news. However, most of these recordings presently reside on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to government censorship, privacy breaches, and data loss. While social media is an acceptable distribution platform, it does not provide sufficient privacy protections or archival preservation of this vital media. The groups on this panel believe digital freedom is a human right and are working to ensure ethics and civil liberties are woven into the fabric of the technologies that serve their communities.

This session will provide an overview of the challenges and opportunities faced by human-rights technologists working to create accurate, preservation-standard records online from a technical and community-based participatory design perspective. 


Our panel has speakers from four organisations working on these issues, to discuss the ways each group strives to improve digital agency and security. We will discuss how the technologies we build address issues arising at the intersection of human rights, free speech, self expression, and narrative agency. 

We are a diverse panel and want to take advantage of the uniquely attuned group assembled in Valencia to bring the narrative to the forefront in a cohesive, substantial, and action-oriented way. With expertise in participatory media, privacy usability, and citizen journalism, Natalie Cadranel will discuss tested tools, tactics, and ethics involved with collecting, authenticating, and preserving sensitive mobile media. Nathan Freitas will discuss challenges and opportunities that arise when using user generated content for conflict investigation. Core to this is verifying and analysing this mass of content, as well as other challenges including preserving online and offline content and making content accessible and understandable. Kaustubh Srikanth will discuss best practices for securely storing media in a distributed backend ecosystem, and Harlo Holmes will discuss her experience working on SecureDrop and other secure tools made for journalists.


The panel will be followed by a workshop and training where we can share our technologies with the IFF community and gain valuable feedback for future improvements.

The session aims to share the methods used to research and produce empirical data on surveillance, documenting cases of malware attacks against civil society, and the advocacy strategies to fight against abusive state surveillance in countries in Southeast Asia and Tibetan community.

Key questions to discuss:

What's the tactic of surveillance being used? 
Is there new technology being used in this case of surveillance? If yes, what is it?
What's the information they surveil on or/and collecting?
How's the push back from the community or/civil society towards this mass surveillance?
Everyone, anyone who is researching, collecting evidences of state sponsored surveillance and want to share their story-Inform on surveillances happening in SEA and Tibetan community to other regions
-Identify the similarity of state surveillance tactics and way to push back 
-Building solidarity and support network across countries

A perennial challenge for internet freedom activists in southern Africa and other developing regions is how to build activism around online freedoms in areas where internet penetration and levels of access are very low.

In southern Africa internet access is patchy. In South Africa, which has a relatively high level of internet access and economic development, there is a massive digital divide, with poor and working class communities often lacking the most basic levels of access. 

Even when statistics point to a rise in internet access among populations, a closer inspection reveals that &#8216;access&#8217; does not necessarily translate into a rich online experience and meaningful engagement. Recent studies in South Africa showed that an alarming proportion of poorer households that were deemed to have &#8216;access&#8217; to the internet had very little real user experience online. For example, many respondents would only use the internet for things like messaging apps - a lack of resources, media literacy, and high costs of data being major obstacles to more extensive use of the internet.

For many poorer and working class communities - at least in South Africa where material conditions can be appalling - campaigns for internet freedom can seem like a &#8216;luxury&#8217; and the preoccupation of urban middle class elites. This is not to say that poorer communities do not see value in the internet. Rather, it has more to do with how struggles are prioritised and how struggles around the internet are perceived and framed.

In South Africa, for instance, activism in poorer communities tends to focus on data costs - something that would affect wealthier users less. Among wealthier communities, on the other hand, activism would tend to focus on, for instance, legislative threats to online expression (a proposed bill to regulate &#8216;harmful content&#8217; online being a case in point). This had led to a massive disconnect in internet activism between wealthier and poorer communities.

The aim of this session would be to explore ways in which to help build activist capacities and collaboration across material divides, fostering a shared sense of activism and ownership of the internet as a vital public space. 
Everyone, especially activists from low income countriesPragmatic steps for how to bridge the digital divide and build cross-class and cross-border solidarity in struggles for internet freedom and access (freedom and access being two sides of the same coin). 

Plans for making the discourse of internet activism more accessible and universal (this could be broadened to a discussion around 'decolonising' internet spaces)

One of the key solutions towards organizational memory are policies which are in place for retention of that memory even when people within the organization changes. 

During first part of the session(20min), I would like to share my own experience as a fellow with Tibet Action Institute where I was tasked with working with one of the largest Tibetan NGO's in Exile and how I have worked towards institutionalization of such a policy and the challenges and successes that I have experienced. 

The second part of the session(40min), would be focused around others in the room who are Digital Security Trainers and implementers on how they have been able to institutionalize Digital Security Policy and figure out best practices towards. 

Digital Security Trainers, Rapid Responders, others who are working with communities and organizations with limited resources.

The research work being carried out by ADC in Argentina, and more broadly in Latin America, allowed us to reach certain observations: In general, public policies related to the use of these types of technologies are carried out with little or no transparency vis-&#224;-vis society; the lack of precise information, which varies country to country, about the technologies and mechanisms being used for the collection, analysis and storage of the biometric data, and the use cases behind such technologies (e.g. the purpose of the data, who will have access to it, if it will be shared and transferred between different public or private bodies); and finally the lack of sufficient legal frameworks to guarantee an adequate treatment of the biometric data collected, both by the State and the private sector. Additionally, the research by CIS in India and other jurisdictions in Asia shows that biometric identification systems are being portrayed as critical to the use of online services such as e-governance or e-commerce platforms, and facilitates the generation of enormous amounts of transactional data. In India, the biometric identity is envisioned as a &#8216;cradle to grave&#8217; identity. This unique identifier is key to the integration of different government and private sector databases and poses serious risks of profiling, function creep, lack of accountability and regulation by code.

With this session we aim to address some of the more pressing issues regarding the implementation of biometric technologies in our societies, specifically:

a) Threats to bodily integrity and dignity: how biometrics reduce an individual to a number represented through a biometric sequence.

b) Irreversible damages in case of breach: unlike passwords, biometrics &#8211;such as our fingerprints, our faces, iris or voice&#8211; cannot be changed; so once compromised, the damage is irreversible.

c) Are biometrics appropriate forms of identifiers? How can we answer questions around uniqueness, discrimination and bias, resolving false positives and false negatives, as well as the change of biometrics over time (e.g. age or medical conditions that may affect our bodies).

d) How biometrics are changing our perception of public spaces, specially due to technologies such as facial recognition?

e) How are biometric based identification systems reconfiguring the relationship between citizen and state?  

Together with CIS, we will give a brief overview of the current trends in Latin America and Asia, in order to set the context of the conversation and then allow participants to freely express their own personal/professional expertise to learn about their concerns and experiences in terms of how biometric technologies have affected their day to day lives.Anyone who finds privacy, biometrics and identity interesting themes and/or wants to learn more about them; people who are doing work to solve this issues and want to share their findings or even their problems/setbacks. Since digital identities is a growing global phenomenon, it is arguable that this session is of interest to everyone, especially those in regions where it is being adopted. 

Journalists, graphic designers and people working in communication/media will learn about what are the main concerns with biometrics from a legal/policy and technology perspective, and we can form collaborations to help develop new ideas on how to better communicate our findings and recommendations.Stories, experiences, testimonials, in depth explanations, from participants that would help further our understanding of how biometric technologies used for the identification of individuals are impacting their daily lives and are starting to shape the future of our societies.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/189</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="31">ambersinha07</person></persons></event><event id="32"><date>2018-03-08T14:30:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>2:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>Journalism, Media and Communications</track><abstract /><title>How to communicate under dictatorship context</title><description>It would be a descriptive session about our latest communication project called Humano Derecho Radio Estaci&#243;n, an online radio that broadcast 24/7 radio shows about humano rights using rock music as a pilar and a way to engage this topics whit new audience.

There have been some very encouraging developments in particular aspects of digital security service delivery, while other areas still lack the kind of sophistication and organization required to achieve consistent good results in securing users. We will discuss these different areas, and how they have progressed. We will examine what we have learned works, and what does not. And we will explore some new theories, strategies, and tactics with a view to raising the competency and outcomes across the whole civil society digital security ecosystem.Anyone interested in how the rapid response for civil society space is maturing, and what the future could look like for the delivery of digital security services to at-risk users. Digital security service providers, funders, service recipient organizations, etc.2018 will be a significant year for the delivery of digital security services to civil society. We believe our learning and understanding of the past 6 years has brought us to a point where we can apply now proven techniques across a much broader set of organizations and digital security services, to effect a much greater result for a larger number of at-risk civil society users. The outcome we are looking for at IFF is to present our vision, and invite other organizations to take our processes and learning, and to join together in a more wholistic ecosystem.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/480</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="33">Gustaf Bj&#246;rksten</person></persons></event><event id="34"><date>2018-03-08T12:15:00</date><start>12:15</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Theater</duration><track>Advocacy, Policy and Research</track><abstract /><title>How to engage in cyber debates: furthering society's capacity to challenge bad policy</title><description>In 2017, ADC, Karisma and TEDIC began a joint research project that examines the contemporary narratives and processes that shape the cyber security agenda in Latin America, and in doing so, questions the approaches that undermine the rights of individuals, particularly the right to privacy.

During the first phase of the project, we published a policy paper that deepens the analysis of principles crafted by Latin American civil society organizations, in order to develop a substantive analysis that can serve as a resource for civil society organizations, individuals, technical experts, and journalists in Latin America and other regions around the world, that will help drive a more human rights-oriented cyber security agenda. This paper delves into cybersecurity narratives to address the more pressing issues and give concrete recommendations, actions and steps to follow in order to guide the development of national cybersecurity policies towards the respect and protection of human rights, while meeting the challenges that technological developments pose for States and their economic and social development.

In this session we will:

- Give a brief overview of the first phase of our research, explaining the findings, main concerns and recommendations from a Civil Society point of view;
- Invite participants to tell us about their own experiences in this subject, in order to learn more about cyber policy making processes in various countries and regions;
- How can we develop a comparative framework that allow us to study, compare and track how cybersecurity policies are being drafted and implemented in different countries. What are the variables that we need to take into consideration? How can we collect and analyze this knowledge in a comparative way?
- Discuss the role of multilateral and/or international organizations on the development of national cyber security policies and strategies, and identify good practices that can be implemented in the Latin American context.
Anyone who wants to share their experience in cybersecurity or learn more about how to challenge set narratives, to a more human rights respecting approach.
Ideas, testimonials and/or experiences from participants regarding cybersecurity policy making in their own countries and regions.

As more grassroots activists and NGO representatives are adopting digital tools into their work, we found that their general understanding of security protocols and possible consequences of insecure exposure to digital communities is structurally trailing behind, leading to all sorts of unexpected outcomes.

After assessing, we understand that most of the women&#8217;s rights activists have what appears to be shared experiences, although most of them have been experiencing them in isolation, making them therefore extra vulnerable. 

In this overview, we outline clusters of challenges that affect activists across a spectrum of grassroots/security contexts, and the limited responses we have been able to provide. Given that these challenges are just emerging, we do not think that the responses given so far have been adequate and would like to use the IFF presentation and discussion as an opportunity to compare experiences across different regions, and streamline and customize our responses to ensure challenges are adequately addressed. Regional trainers, grassroots activists, digital security/gender and security experts. This session could fall under theme "On the Frontlines" or "Training and Best Practices" We would like to use the IFF presentation and discussion as an opportunity to compare experiences across different regions, and streamline and customize our training responses to the delineated challenges to ensure these are more adequate and effective.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/558</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="38">ITM</person></persons></event></room><room name="Flyover Front"><event id="39"><date>2018-03-08T23:00:00</date><start>23:00</start><duration>-1 day, 14:00</duration><duration>Flyover Front</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>Exploring strategies for public awareness on security data breaches of individuals involving personally identifiable information</title><description>Should we all consider Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) be a basic right? On 2017, a Malaysian nationwide well-known online forum Lowyat.net has reported through an article that roughly 46.2 million of mobile phone numbers from Malaysian telcos and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) have been leaked online. The leak includes postpaid and prepaid numbers, customer details, addresses as well as sim card information &#8211; including unique IMEI and IMSI numbers. The forum also confirmed that there was an individual who tries to sell the leak data in their forum to make a quick profit. This has impact nationwide consumers security and privacy. In response to Lowyat.net&#8217;s article, Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) decided to requested the removal of their article. The same article was reposted by another news website Free Malaysia Today (FMT) which also then removed from their website. The information available can be exploited to initiate multiple social engineering attacks against affected users. In this workshop, we would like to explore several areas that involves in Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) worldwide, particularly in Southeast Asia region such as: best practices about public awareness of data breach, the role of telco companies, governments, and other responsible parties on consumers rights when data breach happens, and will the guilty parties be punished for failing to keep their customers' data private?Journalists, Software Developers, Security Trainers, Designers, Usability, Advocacy/Policy Professional, Communications Professionals, Academia, Front Line ActivistsA framework about best practices about public awareness of data breach, and steps required to hold guilty parties accountable</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/277</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="39">Nany</person></persons></event><event id="40"><date>2018-03-08T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Flyover Front</duration><track>Healthier Networks and Organizations</track><abstract /><title>So far, yet so close: working in healthy and succesful remote teams</title><description>A global movement needs global collaboration and that does not always happen in an office.

This is a chance for you to find tools that meet the needs of your community, and make it available for use through localization. This isn't just alumni, individuals new to localization would be welcomed to work collaboratively on internet freedom tools, with the support of select developers. 

We start the IFF Localization Sprint with an hour-long Speed Dating round, for language groups to meet with developers in rotating, short demo sessions, that will showcase the diverse selection of Internet Freedom tools supported this year. In the past we have organized groups by regional or language group so that they can focus questions and discussion on the regional application and relevance of the tools. 

This will be a space for individuals to kick start and potentially finish translation of projects in the company of their peers and with the support of Localization Lab staff and developers to answer questions and help them plan continued localization efforts. Sprints like this are not only an efficient way to localize tools, but a great way to build regional and linguistic networks within the Internet Freedom space.

The event will appeal to a large audience at IFF who are interested in learning about available digital security and circumvention tools. It will also seamlessly lead into the localization sprint, giving participants a better sense of the tools they would like to focus on in the sprint, providing necessary context for the translation and helping to build more personal relationships between translators and developers.Everyone. This session is literally to make internet freedom technology available to everyone, and not just English-speakers.Last year's IFF localization sprint was our most successful--and what made it so great was the number of people who walked in throughout the sprint to learn and partake in this work, who wouldn't have normally done so, the new projects and volunteers we got, and the amount of localization we got done in a half day sprint.

We hope to do more of this as last year, to build communities around technology, especially language groups from countries with restrictive internet governance. The most clear, measurable outcome would of course be the amount of localization that gets done, which we report back to IFF, along with a short report on the event.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/640</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="41">Dragana</person></persons></event></room><room name="Visual Room"><event id="42"><date>2018-03-08T12:15:00</date><start>12:15</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Visual Room</duration><track>Advocacy, Policy and Research</track><abstract /><title>Cyber security in the global south: giving the tin man a heart</title><description>Protecting and defending individuals, devices and networks should form the basis of any cyber security strategy. However, when governments argue for security they often argue for something different. Ambitious, positive and forward looking national cyber security strategies often contradict the reality, as governments force through repressive cyber security and cyber crime laws that focus on criminalising behavior and increasing state surveillance powers rather than addressing the root problem of insecure systems. With this approach, there is a good chance that work on essential and actual security will be under-resourced or ignored, such as securing systems against data breaches, securing critical infrastructure and supporting security research that identifies vulnerabilities &#8211; all of which is an investment in securing systems for the future.

This interactive session draws on examples of the research, advocacy and policy work of PI and partners in challenging cyber security laws in Africa and Latin America. It is an opportunity for attendees challenging cyber security laws in their own country to workshop questions, identify targets and begin to formulate effective strategies to ensure cybersecurity laws and policies are designed to respect and protect human rights, rather than undermine and curtail them.
Members of the community working on cyber security issues and would like more support to enable effective challenges to cyber security laws.
Attendees gain an understanding of the trends in national/regional cyber security landscape and how to challenge policy and laws that undermine human rights.

PI gains more understanding of the cyber security challenges in attendee countries, which will feed into our wider work supporting civil society to challenge cyber security laws.

Use your own e-mail address without needing to learn about key management, PGP, or other hassles (though you still can if you want to!)

This workshop includes opportunities to provide feedback to developers for future improvements. The session is a follow up from our 2h session at IFF 2017 where we collected and discussed with diverse attendees after we gave a UI demo about mail encryption.  Our IFF 2018 session is rather a practical hands-on sessions where attendees learn how to use Autocrypt-enabled mail apps. We are also eager to gather feedback to further drive improvements and new Autocrypt features.  

Autocrypt  is a new specification for opportunistic e-mail end-to-end encryption with E-mail messages. It is available in beta or developer channels for K9/Android, Enigmail/Thunderbird and Delta.chat, a new messenger using e-mail as a backend for a "messenger" UI. After a brief intro we will get all attendees installed with an Autocrypt-capable e-mail client, using their pre-existing e-mail address. Platforms supported will include Android phones and MacOS, Windows, and GNU/Linux laptops.  We will try to provide new e-mail accounts for people who don't feel comfortable using one of their existing e-mail addresses for communication. In the second part of the session we'll mail and message each other and explore usability and security issues.  We want everyone to leave with a good understanding of how Autocrypt feels and works ... and also how to feed back issues into the various Autocrypt developments, including the shard Autocrypt specification itself.

The Autocrypt project is driven by a diverse group of mail app developers, hackers and researchers who are willing to take fresh approaches, learn from past mistakes, and collectively aim to increase the overall encryption of e-mail in the public Internet. Autocrypt uses regular e-mail messages between people's existing e-mail accounts to piggyback necessary information to allow encrypting subsequent messages; it adds a new Autocrypt e-mail header for transferring public keys and driving encryption behaviour. By default, key management is not visible to users.

The group effort was born and named &#8220;Autocrypt&#8221; on December 17th 2016 by ~20 people during a 5-day meeting at the OnionSpace in Berlin. Follow up meetings took place in March during IFF 2017 and partial meetings during summer and a major "Autumn Level 1 closure" meeting is to take place Nov 3-7th November 2017 in Freiburg. We strive to have it remain a dynamic, fun process which is open to new people, influences and contributions.

The session is for anyone who wants to get started on using encrypted E-mail without the need to manually manage PGP keys or to understand how encryption mathematically works.   It is also for any implementers of E-mail clients who are considering UI/UX patterns and want to consider adding support for Autocrypt.
We want participants to walk away with their Android devices or laptop configured and tested to have easy, functional e-mail encryption.

We want participants to feel comfortable and confident in recommending Autocrypt to friends and colleagues without incurring a major support obligation ("you broke my e-mail help me fix it!").

We want mail client developers to feel inspired to add this functionality to their clients.

On top of sim card registrations, this measure has made it extremely unsafe for activists and journalists to conduct their work. 
Using Ethiopia as an example, this session will be a conversation about how other governments are further narrowing the spaces activists, journalists, and citizens have for privacy, security, and freedom of expression. 
We will ask participants to share best practices and tactics they use to secure their communications in highly surveilled spaces.  Although this session is relevant for the whole IFF community,  it is mainly for those that come from highly censored and surveilled places and others that can share surveillance and censorship circumvention tips relevant for the context of the Global South. We are hoping that the conversation will help us share our experiences of surveillance and censorship and collect tips and tools that will help counter unwarranted surveillance and censorship in countries like Ethiopia. We also want to create the space to learn more about new forms oppressions via digital means. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/332</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="46">Berhan Taye</person></persons></event><event id="47"><date>2018-03-08T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>2:00</duration><duration>La Factoria</duration><track>Journalism, Media and Communications</track><abstract /><title>Tackling online harassment</title><description>The Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Women&#8217;s Media Foundation and Troll-Busters.com highly recommend the inclusion of a two-hour interactive discussion intended to spur a solutions-oriented approach to addressing the persistent issue of online harassment of women in the media. This would serve as a follow up to the panel that IWMF and CPJ co-sponsored in 2017 which sought to highlight the scope of the issue of online harassment against women journalists. Digital harassment is often seen as less significant than physical abuse, but in fact online harassment can often intersect with physical harassment or intimidation of women, and can have an extreme impact on the personal and professional lives of women journalists, and the decisions they make about what and how they report.
 
While many strides have been made in recognizing the scope of the issue, there is still a dearth of information, research, solutions, best practices when it comes to addressing online harassment of women journalists. There remains a vital need for a more comprehensive response, including guidelines, laws, monitoring, and tools to address the problem. We propose a solutions-oriented discussion with contributors from an array of geographic regions and areas of expertise, who can delve into how we can effectively combat digital threats moving forward. We intend to build upon the advances that have been made in this space, while furthering the conversation around a number of salient issues that emerged during last year&#8217;s session including how to expand the research, better understanding and addressing state/non-state attacks/harassment, and the development of both individual and institutional response mechanisms and support networks. Our goal is to emerge from this session with some tangible  takeaways, and a framework for thinking about best practices. Journalists 
Technologists
Civil society groups
Safety specialists
People who work with at risk communities
To strengthen the network of groups working on this issue
To see the outcomes of this feed directly into the solutions documenting and research efforts, including by CPJ who intends to engage on this issue throughout 2018 and ultimately publish recommendations and information gathered on solutions. 
To ensure that those working in or with social media groups understand the nature and scope of the threats and the kinds of responses that are needed
- To insure that the recommendations and experiences of a variety of people are reflected in the ongoing advocacy efforts of groups like CPJ, IWMF and TrollBusters with groups like GNI, the Facebook safety initiative, or bodies of the UN.

Based on the results of the study, the purpose is to debate how the breakdown of net neutrality impacts access and the concept of a free and open internet. The point of departure is that net neutrality should be seen as a principle and that its rupture directly affects the way society accesses the Internet. The panel  will present an overview of access obstacles in the region and how commercial practices as zero rating are harmful to user rights.Another point of debate is access to internet as an essential service; therefore, its neutrality must be guaranteed so that everyone can enjoy this service in its fullness. The regional perspective of focusing on net neutrality and access in the global south brings to light the possibility of disseminating information from this region to other actors and stakeholders from around the world who will be on the IFF.Who Would Benefit The Most From Your Session?): Civil society organizations and activists who work with the issue of connectivity, who advocate universal access to the Internet and its neutrality, and who are interested in the subject of Internet regulation.- presentation of the net neutrality scenario in Latin American countries; - presentation of how net neutrality is a principle that must be preserved on the Internet; - to learn about experiences of net neutrality practices; - to exchange experiences on how these four countries have build regulations that protect the net neutrality; - to elaborate inputs on how to address net neutrality issues such as zero-rating in countries where internet access is still a challenge.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/13</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="50">Marcos Urupa</person></persons></event><event id="51"><date>2018-03-07T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>2:00</duration><duration>Attic</duration><track>Healthier Networks and Organizations</track><abstract /><title>Diversity is our strength: communications for identity and networking</title><description>Diversity and inclusion are two conditions that any organisational network requires to survive and grow in the current fast-changing environment. But achieving both can be definitely challenging, and we believe the internal and external communications have a huge role to play in this equation. How to generate an identity that is inclusive enough but also respects the diversity of the parts? APC, as the oldest organisational network working on internet and ICTs, with 55 organisational members and 30 individual members active in 76 countries to date, has several insights and learnings to share in this regard. Working around a specific case, we will share our challenges, most foreseeable future concerns, ask for suggestions, develop a creative thinking elicitation exercise, like lateral association or how we play with same messages on different mediums. Activists active in organisational networks, communications people, or any person interested in organisational communications, and community building. * Shared insight on communicating for inclusion, in diversity
 * Increased awareness of how to communicate a common message respecting diversity (both from the emisors and engaged constituencies)
 * Visibility of APC as a member-based network with experience in the field

In fact, in digital security trainings, we must adapt the ways in which we collect useful information from users that can help shape and improve technologies they need the most. Trainers play a critical role in this feedback loop, as they tend to work with higher risk communities (who are often hard to engage with safely), and have a deeper understanding of the humans actually using and in need of security and privacy. 

During the past year, the USABLE (https://usable.tools) team has been working with trainers, developers, and designers to craft sessions and activities within digital security workshops that capture much needed information required in making usability improvements. This session will be a hands on walk-through where trainers, developers and designers can experience first hand what it&#8217;s like to capture user feedback in a digital security training and provide input and recommendations around ways we can improve the process.  The walk-through will be co-led by Megan DeBlois (Internews), Helen Nyinakiiza (Defend Defenders), Bridget Sheerin (ThoughtWorks) and will focus on one of the following:

* Tool Feedback Collection: Tool-specific feedback collection activities that trainers can easily run in a digital security training with the purpose of sending to the developer afterward.

* Persona Generation: Sessions or exercises trainers are already running or they can run easily in parallel with their digital security training with the purpose of having users generate their own personas, or profiles, of themselves (see template).
Digital Security Trainers, Developers, and Designers
Concrete improvements to the feedback collection models proposed.

Directly connect developers, trainers, and designers with one another. Specifically we would like trainers to connect directly with other open-source tool developers (e.g. VeraCrypt, KeePass, Signal, Enigmail, Tor, Jitsi Meet). 

Raise awareness around the importance of trainers in the feedback and design process in software development for high risk communities.

This session is a chance to engage with broader conversations about the directions, challenges and hopes for feminist infrastructure. 
 
The types of activities, campaigns and organizations that feminist infrastructure providers support are on the front lines of repression, violence and surveillance. Not only are feminist infrastructure providers working on mission critical communications and technical support projects for at-risk users and organizations, the women and non-binary people responsible for the servers, access and technical skills are themselves often working in oppressive conditions, both offline and online. 
 
Through sharing and mapping, we&#8217;ll use the session to outline strategies for nurturing solidarity and mentorship within nodes of feminist infrastructure projects and explore opportunities for existing services and organizational sustainability.

This will lay the ground for a discussion of which countermeasures, legal, political and technical, are available to human rights defenders and journalists when confronted with them.

The general tendency to militarize the police has a technical component besides vehicles, weapons and tactics. Often of military origin, a wide array of sensors and software designed to gather and process data about populations are available to police forces the world over.

If you are part of a marginalized community, organizing protests, or voicing dissent, this is a non-exhaustive list of some of the technologies that can be used to invade your private life, suppress your efforts of free expression and free assembly:

    Stingrays
    Automatic license plate readers (ALPRs)
    Electronic toll readers or E-ZPass
    Closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV; video surveillance)
    Biometric surveillance technology
    Gunshot detection and location hardware and services (ShotSpotter)
    X-ray vans (Z Backscatter Vans)
    Surveillance enabled lightbulbs (Surveillance capable bulbs or fixtures)
    Hacking software and hardware
    Social media monitoring software or SMMS
    Through-the-wall sensors/radar (TTWS)
    Police body cameras
    Predictive policing software

We will not get into each and every one of the different technologies but outline what we feel are the most relevant in a human rights context and keep the session open for input from the expertise and experience of the participants. The last part of the session will be an open discussion of experiences and mitigation strategies.

The goal of the session is to establish a clear cut assessment of what is out there and to what extent so it's possible to take appropriate countermeasures and mitigate risks.- Human rights defenders.
- Security trainers.
- Journalists.Participants will have gained overview knowledge of the landscape of policing technologies that human rights defenders and journalists are confronted with.

Collaboratively, various approaches to mitigating the risks of these technologies will be collected and shared.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/375</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="58">Henrik Chulu</person></persons></event><event id="59"><date>2018-03-07T15:45:00</date><start>15:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Gallery</duration><track>On the Frontlines</track><abstract /><title>Internet censorship in the era of social media</title><description>Internet censorship in the era of social media.

The measures that governments take to restrict their citizens&#8217; freedom of expression or access to information often mean blocking websites,  digital surveillance, or DDos attack the online targets.  As our speech increasingly takes place on social media platforms&#8212;like Facebook or Twitter, future-looking news media are also in the process of transformation. A whatsapp group, telegram channel or facebook group might be even more important distribution channel than a website. In the mean time, governments such as China also extended its control of information to those social media platforms, especially on Chinese domestic companies such as Sina Weibo and WeChat.  This introduces both new challenges and opportunities in terms of battling online censorship.

In this panel session, we would like to provide a general review of current online censorship measures adopted by repressive states and also compare their policy and practices.  Our presentations will be speaking on following topics, mostly around blocking and unblocking websites.

1. Excuses, which governments use to justify censorship
2. Enforcing censorship &#8212; keeping lists of banned items (which is no small feat), technical methods used to enforce censorship (firewalls, mostly, but DDoS attacks are another creative way to go)
3. Ways to battle censorship &#8212; &#8216;official ways&#8217;, e.g. courts, parliament, not very helpful in given countries, but anyway, worth mentioning;
4. Censorship circumvention methods &#8212; this is where things get interesting &#8212; hopping from domain to domain, collaborative freedom

Social media platforms and mobile apps raise in importance as a news distribution channel. Naturally, ways to censor them and censorship circumvention methods for them raise in importance too.  In the second part of this panel, we will be focusing on censorship in the social media, and how to combat it. We will evaluate different social media platform on the same four scales and see, how we can see the same old principles applied to those new platforms, and how seriously this kind of censorship can affect social media users. We will talk about emergence of new trends, most notably the censorship of live videos, and  of course, there will be new, unique opportunities and challenges as well.

We will use Russia, Kazakhstan , Iran and China as our main examples.For news media organisations and technology professionals.Encrypted SNI in TLS protocol would would be nice ;)

This shutdowns were met very calmly and tolerant by most local human and media rights defenders. Ukraine is in the state of war with Russia since 2014 after Crimea occupation. Thus, for many human rights defenders Internet Freedom was not so crutial as national security issues, despite of dispropotional restrictions which is illegal. There is also lack of understanding of IF concept at all, that it's a vital value for freedom of expression and freedom of speech. It has led to lack of nonprofessional (I mean despite of ISP asociation wich deals with business) community in Ukraine to protect and advocate IF in Ukraine 
So, we have further steps, attempts to restrict IF in Ukraine. 
The main focus of this workshop is to develop main messages and methods to spread information in conflict society about the value of Internet Freedom. 
I am sure, many countries have passed the same periods. Maybe we could develop something really usefull for societies, where human rights defenders are under patriotism blindness and are tolerant to violations of basic rights. For people and experts from countries where Internet shutdowns are going on and accepted very easely be Human Rights defenders, most activists. Where Internet Freedom percepts as good only if it is for patriotic purpose. I think, situation in Katalonia is very same. At least 5 main messages with submessages are developed. At least 2 action plans for spreading the word in conflict societies are proposed by groups. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/66</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="60">Nadiia Babynska</person></persons></event></room><room name="Think Tank"><event id="61"><date>2018-03-07T12:15:00</date><start>12:15</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>Making Better Tech</track><abstract /><title>Firefox &amp; Tor together improving web privacy</title><description>Mozilla and the Tor Project have started an intense collaboration to make the Web more secure and more private.

Using secure enclaves such as Intel SGX, cloud applications can compute on user's data without the provider ever having access to that data. 

But the technology is still maturing. The academic community is excited to help and looking for research, but often detached from user needs. The open source community is just beginning to get excited about using it in projects, but it's not quite ready for non-expert use. Let's help them find their next project, and help them help us build our next great defensive tool.

First, we'll briefly go over what enclaves are, what problems they solve, where they're currently lacking, and how to use them given current tooling.

Then, we'll discuss what the community's needs are, so that we can call for specialists to improve specific areas. How does the threat model fit in with developer needs? What's a blocking problem? What assurances would it need to give? What features would it need to have? What toolchains would be best for it to fit in with? Anyone who builds tools with server-side components and cares about protecting users will have valuable contributions in this discussion.Anyone who builds tools with server-side components and cares about protecting users will have valuable contributions to this discussion, and wants to learn more about an emerging technology.Through the discussion, we will discover the most important places where work is still needed. These discoveries will be conveyed to various groups working to improve the technology, so that all will benefit from it sooner.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/128</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="69">Erica Portnoy</person></persons></event></room><room name="Flyover Front"><event id="70"><date>2018-03-07T23:00:00</date><start>23:00</start><duration>-1 day, 14:00</duration><duration>Flyover Front</duration><track>Journalism, Media and Communications</track><abstract /><title>A culture of digital safety in journalism: developing industry minimum standards, best practices in privacy and infosec</title><description>In response to an alarming increase in physical threats to journalists, an unprecedented coalition of journalist organizations and freelancers called the ACOS Alliance formed in 2015 to establish minimum safety principles in the industry, which many major media organizations endorsed. A similar set of standards and best practices are badly needed to address digital threats faced by journalists, media organizations, and the people and communities they cover &#8212; and this brainstorming session aims to begin developing just that. How can newsrooms and editors better protect the information they receive? How can they keep their journalists safer? How can journalists address the digital security and privacy of their subjects? What sort of minimum training should be required to address different threat models? Scenarios discussed can include doxxing, online harassment, surveillance, seizure of devices, anonymity and privacy of sensitive sources, information sharing within newsrooms, access to tools, access to trainings, regional barriers or considerations, ethical responsibilities of journalists and media organizations, etc.  Journalists, photojournalists, videographers, freelancers, and editors who commission and work with journalists doing high-risk work in the field. Tech folks, privacy folks, and others interested in helping to make systemic improvements to media organizations' OpSec/InfoSec muscle memory. 

The objective is to collectively develop the beginnings of a broadly-applicable minimal set of digital safety standards and best practices for editors, newsroom staff, freelancers, and others in the media. By the end of IFF, I would like to have a robust working document and a clear set of next steps to refine, circulate, and implement. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/409</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="70">shoefleur</person></persons></event><event id="71"><date>2018-03-07T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Flyover Front</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>How we imagine consent in a data society?</title><description>An hour-length conversation on how we imagine consent in a data society. 

As societies that depend increasingly upon internet, we rely greatly on terms of services (ToS). We trust that our informed consent regarding ToS will make a difference when we need to choose among services: those who protect better our rights and are suitable for our needs will be chosen, freely. 

From a gender perspective, consent is a core element to avoid gender violence. For example, informed consent will make a fundamental difference regarding women being able to experience sexual freedom on the internet, or being a victim of gender violence through the publication of non-consensual pornography on the internet.

Nonetheless all this fundamental trust on consent, nowadays we are experiencing a crisis on what it means and how it works. Every day we can see how this concept is undermined. For example, every time we accept Terms of Services that we don't read or even understand, or when users don't really have any power to negotiate those legal conditions, or even now with new technologies as facial recognition and internet of things, where consent is dubious. Things get more interesting when consent is a core part to avoid abuses and violence on the internet and outside of it. 

As activists and researchers, it's time to think how we can envision a meaningful consent in data society. We strongly believe that social practices, different approaches on policies, and creative technologies can work together to imagine an internet more fair and free, where informed consent can be more than just an empty concept. This session will be the start of a conversation that the presenters hope to continue in their own research and activism, but also, we hope it could be present in the different participants' activities.
If you are a feminist or work with gender perspective on internet issues, in this session you will find a way to reflect on how gender violence on internet could be crossed by the erode of consent in our every-day online services.

If you work on policy regarding data, data protection and/or privacy, in this session we will discuss how we can enforce consent in a more meaningful way that what is happening today.

If you work designing technologies or any other solutions, we will happy to hear your perspective on how a meaningful consent could work in your services, even experimenting crazy ideas around technical solutions.
List of what are the problems the community perceive regarding how consent is conceived today on the internet.

List of what are the future problems that the present idea of consent will have with increasing data societies.

What would be a meaningful consent for the internet we want. We want to have social, political and technical perspectives.

The problem is that, as activists, we might see clearly what will happen if we don't intervene to make sure technological developments are done taking human rights into consideration. But what can we do when most people are not even aware of the threats that technologies can pose to rights, and therefore do not understand the consequences of not intervening quickly in key areas? Future scenarios is a technique that can be used to have people reflect on the evolution of technologies into neutral, nice and not-so-nice potential futures, and discover the differences among them. Based on a solid, logical framework of potential indicators on how things can evolve, then turned into human stories for reflection, the methodology has a wide variety of applications. 
In this session we will introduce participants to the methodology of alternate future scenarios, based on future&#8217;s studies theories (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_studies). The session has three parts:
Part I: We will explain the methodology of future&#8217;s thinking and describe four potential future scenarios (continuity, collapse, transformation, discipline) applied to technologies and themes we are concerned with.
Part II: We will work together with participants in developing stories on alternate futures for selected key themes like privacy, big data, algorithms, IoT, smart cities, or others of their interest. This will help in understanding how to apply the methodology for our projects.  
Part III: The session will close with a general reflection on what we can learn from the methodology and how we can use the future scenarios tool to develop more solid funding proposals and carry out advocacy activities.
Note: This session can be done in English, Spanish or both languages (not simultaneously).Anyone who is interested in learning a new methodology for analyzing in a logical way the potential evolution of technologies over time and its possible consequences on economic, social and political areas. The methodology can be very useful to work with different audiences in helping to understand the future evolution of technologies and how we can make a difference with our interventions (and what might happen if we don't do anything at all!).- Participants will be able to understand the alternative future's scenario methodology (based on a variation of the &#8220;Institute for the Future&#8221; map of the decade project  - http://www.iftf.org/our-work/global-landscape/ten-year-forecast/2010-ten-year-forecast/2010-map-of-the-decade/)
- Participants will be able to apply the methodology to themes and technologies they are concerned with, extracting key ideas for future intervention
- Participants will be able to reflect on the methodology and identify how they can apply it for advocacy, research and fundraising activities.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/403</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="72">Roxana Bassi</person></persons></event><event id="73"><date>2018-03-07T14:30:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Flyover Front</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>Queering digital security and internet freedom</title><description>The Internet Freedom and Digital Security space has not been a space of queer inclusion. Whether it's the creation of guides that claim to address queer communities but don't involve or work with them during the process or creating spaces that marginalize and ignore queer identities, marginalization of queer communities and their lived realities exist in the human rights and digital security spaces. This session is an attempt to empower and amplify the voices of queer identities. It will be structured as a conversation, confessional, support group, open Q&amp;A, working group, disruption, or whatever other forms the group of queer voices and allies take form. There will be no set topics other than to claim space for all marginalzied queer identities--trans*, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, anyone who does not want to or cannot be labeled--within a space that has marginalized and ignored us. The only goal for this session is to start the process of imagining a 'queer' Internet and community. In the spirit of queerness as a rejection of classifications and categories, we won't attempt to define the term or classify people/groups. Instead, we will use radical and transformative openness to how we can create consensual and 'queer' futures. If you are interested in this session and don't know where to start, the accounts in Queer Privacy (https://leanpub.com/queerprivacy) provide a number of different queer perspectives from North America and the UK.This session is for all the queer people: trans*, genderqueer, gender non-conforming, kinksters, and anyone who does not want to or cannot be labeled. Allies and supporters of the queer communities are welcome. Trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs) and other people who have a history of transphobia, queerphobia, whorephobia, kinkphobia, or any other queer exclusion and marginalization are not welcome.Claiming of a space for queer voices and visibility Developing a vision of a 'queer' and consensual Internet.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/243</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="73">Lesego Tlhwale</person></persons></event></room><room name="Visual Room"><event id="74"><date>2018-03-07T12:15:00</date><start>12:15</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Visual Room</duration><track>On the Frontlines</track><abstract /><title>Help!

So, why not smear some glitter on our session about Twitter to make it more fancier.

Most of us use Twitter - the microblogging social media platform, to connect with each other, to express our opinions on variety of topics, and most importantly to spread news about our communities. All these happens within 140 characters - "short and sweet". In this session we will shed some light on exploring the treasure trove behind those 140 characters, which will probably glitter the uselessness of Twitter, or unglitter the harms of Twitter like any other social media.

We take audience through a journey of what happens when they Tweet their opinions, followed by the Tweet gets retweeted/liked by any of their friends, and finally how the 140 characters become part of a bigger agenda. We will discuss several topics such as infomation war on Twitter (e.g. far right US/French elections, Antifa fights) as well as harassment on Twitter to indulge our audience on a healthy disccusion about some of the issues that our Internet Freedom community is bothered from.

On the other hand, we will also discuss some of our own projects ( - a project aimed to seek attention of the Members of European Parliament to vote for stronger notions of privacy) as well as many cool tools for people to utilize Twitter at scale, especially beyond their own opinions expressed in 140 characters. We would make sure that everyone (let it be activits working on harassment, data visualation enthusiasts, journalists covering controversial topics, or security trainers who are hungry to know more OSINT tools) would learn something new about usecases/useless-cases of Twitter for their local communities/ team members.

Come on you awesome folks, let us glitter the Twitter!- Anyone who knows Twitter
- Anyone who uses Twitter
- Activits working on Internet Freedom issues such online harassment
- Journalists covering controversial topics and political agenda behind online campaigns.
Security trainers, dataviz enthusiasts
Basically, anyone and everyone- Audience would understand how their tweet becomes part of a bigger political agenda, or target of a specific campaign/advertisement/something else.
- Audience would learn about difference projects and tools to explore Twitter at scale.
Connect the communities working on various Internet freedom issues and possibly have a presence of Twitter.
- Engage the participants to help each other and explore more, beyond our session and beyond our imagination.

The session will encompass challenges related to privacy and data protection in times of biometrics technology. In recent years, advancement in biometrics technology has led to it being used for identification in a multitude of places, from airport security to delivering subsidies. While the benefits of using biometrics is manifold, one cannot disregard the privacy and data protection concerns related to it. Biometrics information is considered an individual&#8217;s &#8216;sensitive personal data&#8217; and its wrongful exploitation can be used for the purposes of mass surveillance and profiling. As regards data protection, every database is susceptible to hacking, even by employing strong security measures, and since biometric data is immutable, its compromise means that there is no going back. Another question that arises in the context of biometrics technology is &#8220;informational self-determination&#8221; , which warrants an individual the right of control over her personal data.
In countries where biometric identification is employed, its use must comply with robust privacy and data protection laws. In India, the biggest biometric identification project in the world was started by the government in 2009 to provide digital identities to residents by generating a 12 - digit unique identification number called &#8220;Aadhaar&#8221; number on the basis of individuals&#8217; biometric and demographic information which is stored in a centralized database, namely Central Identities&#8217; Data Repository. The purpose of the project, as stated initially, was to enable the government to directly transfer subsidies, and benefits to the residents of the country by using the resident&#8217;s Aadhaar number only. 
Since then, the project has witnessed various data leaks and breaches, despite the government claiming that the highest standard of security has been deployed for its protection. The project received widespread backlash for being against the fundamental right to privacy and for being executed without the umbrella of a data protection legislation. 
Aadhaar is a classic example of privacy and data protection failure with respect to biometrics technology.  Apart from India, countries such as Brazil, Ghana and Indonesia have also implemented biometric based identification programs. China&#8217;s facial recognition technology has been in the pipeline since 2015. The technology will be deployed in public places to identify lawbreakers. The Government of China also plans to implement a &#8220;national social credit system&#8221; by 2020, that would assign citizens ratings on the basis of their behavior.The session is for anyone who cares about their privacy and would like to learn more about the implications of using biometric technology. This may include members of the civil society, academia, industry, Government, and also jurists and lawmakers.There is no specific outcome that we are looking at, except to educate and enlighten ourselves and others about the flipside of technology. Technological advances have made our lives simpler and easier, but it sometimes comes with a hidden cost which is often overlooked. Notwithstanding the myriad benefits that technology provides, we need to ensure that it does not override our civil liberties and fundamental rights. The session will provide insights into biometrics technology and help us make cautious choices the next time we hand over our biometrics.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/358</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="78">PrriyankaC</person></persons></event><event id="79"><date>2018-03-07T23:00:00</date><start>23:00</start><duration>-1 day, 13:00</duration><duration>Theater</duration><track>Training and Best Practices</track><abstract /><title>Evolution of cyber espionage on the tibetan community in exile</title><description>This session aims at presenting the evolution of targeted malware operations on Tibetan communities over the past 10 years, and how the operators adapted to the trainings and new security measures

This year, we continue the discussion where we left off, covering recent developments in Turkey, Azerbaijan and the wider region looking at the intersection between internet freedom, human rights and independent media. Can political freedoms be restored, and how can we ensure that society is well-represented and inclusive at a time of unprecedented restrictions, with hundreds of journalists and activists behind bars for speaking up. As government rhetoric heats up, where do we draw line and start to rebuild the bridges of civil society?

This year, we take a particular look at real-time communication platforms, instant messaging and controls on the free flow of information online.

Many times they are asked for help, for a piece of advice or just to report cases of harassment and threats. Some of these cases can be referred to through institutional channels, others through specialized organizations in gender violence. But tech-based gender violence has particular manifestations and it requires holistic responses. What steps should we follow when we receive this kind of requests? What can we learn from other protocols? How can those be adapted to the different Latin American contexts? This workshop is a commitment to identify the particularities of sexist violence on the Internet, share experiences of quick response and to establish the basis of a response protocol for these cases.Activist, researchers, HRD, trainers who work in tech-based gender violence.

For many of us, that translates to the organizations we work with, each with unique working cultures and environments. Organizations within the IF community come in many shapes and sizes; however, regardless of their scale or complexity, it is the duty of organizational leadership across the board to create, nurture and value healthy organizational cultures which enable everybody - staff and consultants alike &#8211; to take proper care of themselves, communicate openly and constructively, and feel supported when conflict arises.
 
What are the actual practices of management, communication and operations that must be embraced to create supportive, transparent working environments that respect values of privacy and inclusiveness? How do we foster organizational cultures where team buy-in and shared ownership are not only preached, but practiced? We want, and need, to have an intentional conversation about the impact of organizational working cultures on the ability of individuals to go about their work in a healthy, positive, constructive manner. 

The ultimate goal of this session is to ignite a conversation which leads to a series of collaboratively developed standards &#8211; standards which organizations of all shapes and sizes in our community should embrace to demonstrate their commitment to we the individuals who advance their causes and serve our communities.
Though intended for all participants of the IFF, the participation of the following participant profiles would be highly beneficial: Organizational leadership &#8211; from both implementers and donors; Programmatic and operational decision-makers from large NGOs, distributed and decentralized teams, and local-level orgs; Career freelancers and consultants, as individuals who often contribute to programmatic efforts with differing levels of buy-in compared to full-time staff.The ultimate goal of this session is to ignite a conversation which leads to a series of collaboratively developed standards &#8211; standards which organizations of all shapes and sizes in our community should embrace to demonstrate their commitment to we the individuals who advance their causes and serve our communities.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/456</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="88">Nicolas Sera Leyva</person></persons></event><event id="89"><date>2018-03-06T23:00:00</date><start>23:00</start><duration>-1 day, 13:00</duration><duration>Gallery</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>State-sponsored phishing and disinformation campaigns</title><description>That will be a discussion on recent investigations explaining the involvement of Russian security services (such as GRU and FSB) in physhing attacks that are followed by disinformation campaigns People who are interested in political aspetcs of cyber seciruty issues Better understanding of threats that are posed by authoritarian governments in cyber-security and media spheres</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/319</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="89">Dobrokhotov</person></persons></event><event id="90"><date>2018-03-06T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Gallery</duration><track>Advocacy, Policy and Research</track><abstract /><title>Data selfies and data suckers: internet advocacy through digital art</title><description>We generally associate advocacy work with petitions, pickets, and door-knocking. But powerful advocacy can be more subtle, and far more artistic. In this session, three artist-technologist-activists will talk about imbuing their digital art with a point of view. All three session leaders create art on the internet, for the internet: apps, films, paintings, and other media that tell stories about online privacy and security.

Coding Rights focuses on imbalances that reinforce gender and North/South inequalities. Joana is the force behind Chupadatos, the Data Sucker (https://chupadados.codingrights.org/en/), which uses art and storytelling to highlight how pervasively data is being extracted and used in our daily interactions with our city, our homes, ours bodies and our pocketbooks. It also suggests how we can better protect our personal data. Anyone interested in art, media, the internet, and the intersection of these areas. (So, pretty much everyone.) There&#8217;s something for coders, digital artists, and activists. We want to start a stirring conversation about the role of digital media online, and in the realm of advocacy. We want to empower coders and artists to insert a point of view and principles into their work; and we want to empower activists to leverage all the tools at their disposal.  </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/204</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="90">KevinZawacki</person></persons></event><event id="91"><date>2018-03-06T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Gallery</duration><track>Making Better Tech</track><abstract /><title>Bias in technology - what it is and how to deal with</title><description>Machine learning bias, technological discrimination and algorithmic injustice make headlines.
In this session we want to explore what these terms mean, see how bias in machine learning emerges and how it impacts our life. Despite being harmful when used to target individuals, bias helps us to understand human patterns and is required for any automated classification task.
We talk about how machine learning bias affects the human rights community and which measures have to be taken to benefit from it without harming people.- machine learning practitioners and statisticians, as well as data sceptics

In the context these oppressed groups, a person belonging to an LGBTQI+ community experiences monitoring differently than a cisgendered person, and similarly a person who identifies themselves as a woman experiences this surveillance differently than that of their male counterparts. While the comparison on which kind of surveillance is worse than the other can&#8217;t be made or justified, it&#8217;s important to identify this as a gendered issue - one that the people already living at the brink of oppression encounter in their daily lives, be it at the workplace in the form of CCTV cameras strategically angled, or at public spaces in the form of uncomfortable male gaze, or in an attempt to &#8216;cleanse&#8217; the society by continuous clampdown on gender minority.
This session aims at bringing together vocal activists from diverse backgrounds and orientations to represent their communities and discuss the many struggles that they face in their daily routines as a result of this continuous surveillance of many forms.The session is for anyone who wants to look at surveillance from a new perspective - one that is not very well explored and understood or talked about.1. Identifying surveillance as not just a political issue that affects only the politicians, whistleblowers, or activists, but also as a gendered issue that affects the common people in their daily lives

We want to continue advocating for and creating space for this dialogue. In order to organize and solidify this movement, however, we're proposing a session for Protect Our Spaces--to have a chance to define challenges, dangers, and successes in fighting sexual assault in this space.

It is crucial right now for our community to create a shared vision of what success would look like when it comes to safety, and a harassment-free environment, and a roadmap to get there. In order to keep this conversation pushing forward, we need to identify needs and challenges, and in this structured conversation we plan to focus on further defining these issues and creating sustainable changes. We also will discuss forming a task force, to ensure progress from organizations, individuals, and funders.Though this session is intended for all attendees of the IFF, we want to target the following groups in particular:
-Event Organizers
-Organizational leadership
-Community leaders
-FundersThrough this structured event we identify the most promising ideas and a form a task force to continue working on policy improvements.We want to define clear definitions for "safe spaces", standards for safety and security at events, as well as define what makes impactful codes of conduct and how they are best shared.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/644</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="93">Dragana</person></persons></event></room><room name="Think Tank"><event id="94"><date>2018-03-06T12:15:00</date><start>12:15</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>Internet a la cubana: A different coctel</title><description>Cuba, with one of the best educational indexes registered by UNESCO, has one of the lowest Internet penetration rates in the world. In the last two years, it has begun a slow informatization of society characterized by high prices, the implementation of 3G speed since the second half of 2017, and insufficient public connection points without any privacy consideration. November 2017 has been announced as the start-up of the Internet service in homes, which will start in some areas to gradually expand with equally high prices.
Despite the difficulties, the possibility of connecting to the Internet has been received by Cubans with great interest and popularity. This context occurs in a technological, digital and media illiteracy environment that perfectly complements the control of information and censorship. But, in turn, it has served as a fertilizer for creative forms of digital content dissemination and monetization of these practices.
In this session, we want to present this our first-hand experience and through an interactive discussion that allows attendees to understand how we connect in Cuba, to know how the needs has allowed to look for creative ways to distribute digital content and promote an emerging digital economy, in addition to identifying the security and privacy problems that these forms of connection have. In this way and through an interactive activity (involving a comparison between the quality of Cuban rum vis-a-vis the quality of the Cuban Internet), we will identify the huge disparities that exist in Cuba when talking about the access to the Internet.
This session is for those who want to make contact with a reality like the Cuban one, in which the Internet is object of censorship, and want to know how to Cubans come up with shortcuts to circumvent this circumstance the restrictions (eg Packet, "El Paquete Semanal", Sreet net).The session will result in the exchange of experiences, broaden the catalog of creative practices to connect and share content, as well as a better understanding of the Internet panorama in Cuba.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/259</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="94">Regina</person></persons></event><event id="95"><date>2018-03-06T23:00:00</date><start>23:00</start><duration>-1 day, 13:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>Journalism, Media and Communications</track><abstract /><title>Threatened by the State; disowned by the community</title><description>&#8216;Who is a journalist?&#8217; is a question that Pakistan&#8217;s unions of journalists are pondering on. The answer might mean life or death to some. It will determine whether or not the new breed of journalists, generating excellent digital news content through their websites or news startups, are given a space in the mainstream union structure.

Journalist unions in Pakistan are extremely vibrant and have a history of struggle against oppressors. To them goes the credit of upholding the flag of press freedom. The union representatives are also known for their close ties and strong influence on policymakers, legislators and law enforcement groups. As a result of which, an attempt to intimidate a member never goes unprotested. That combined with the support of members&#8217; parent media house, often big broadcast companies or newspapers, an attack or intimidation of a journalist becomes a headline.

In all, the journalist unions are playing an excellent role to uphold press freedom in Pakistan.

They, however, remain closed to the new generation of journalists &#8212; the digital journalists &#8212; who are often running their news startups, websites, and producing excellent news content on a daily basis. 

Not only that they are denied membership, the unions refuse to acknowledge them as journalists and actively try to undermine any indigenous unionization efforts by them, by terming them &#8216;bloggers&#8217; a rather derogatory term within the journalistic circles. As a result, an attack or intimidation of these digital journalists are often much easier, and almost always remain under the radar of the mainstream media.

The panel discussion will host panelists from Pakistan and India and platforms such as Global Voices and will explore the wide array of factors that build-up to make freelance digital journalists the most unsafe of journalist lot. The session will also feature case-studies from India and Pakistan and will explore alternate ways of unionization for digital journalists and bloggers.The session is for anyone producing journalistic content and who is not a part of mainstream media houses. Freelancers, especially from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh where there have been attacks on digital journalists and bloggers will benefit from the discussionIdeally, we would like to identify similar phenomena in countries like Pakistan who have yet to achieve press freedom. We would also like to explore alternate solutions of unionization and community mobilization.  </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/425</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="95">Asad Baig</person></persons></event><event id="96"><date>2018-03-06T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>Training and Best Practices</track><abstract /><title>How we developed a technical assessment toolkit for former Soviet states and built a community around it</title><description>Activists worldwide are inspired by the concept of the auditing framework Safetag and build their own forks and versions of technical assessment frameworks for their communities.

This setup creates a lot of cyber and information vulnerabilities for Syrian CSOs and media organizations.

Hunadah Al-Hariri who is the Head of Media &amp; Freedoms Unit at the Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), will be elaborating on the topic and sharing her center&#8217;s experience in dealing with media and CSO workers at risk. 
SCM interacts with the Syrian civil society workers who are forced by the complexity of the Syrian situation to work in different environments and thus putting them in a variety of dangers and risks. SCM aims at showcasing these different contexts and provides examples on the types of risks facing these workers. 

Hunadah will be co-hosting the discussion with Joseph Hamud who works with International Media Support as the safety adviser for the Syria program.
Joseph has been training safety focal points working with various Syrian media organizations on safety and risk management. This session is for those who are interested in understanding the Syrian context better, in order to collaborate with actors on the ground in that context to identify cyber and information needs, reduce vulnerabilities, and help media and CSO workers achieve their objectives more securely by applying solutions that are technologically creative and viable in that context. To inform on some of the needs of Syrian civil society, brainstorm on potential solutions for issues and recommendations for best practices, and ideally get help from techies / digital security experts and provide a link between them and workers at risk in the Syrian media and civil society.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/420</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="97">Joseph Hamood</person></persons></event><event id="98"><date>2018-03-06T14:30:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>On the Frontlines</track><abstract /><title>Anything you do online can be used against you: cross-border access to data from a human rights perspective</title><description>Access to electronic data has become a fundamental tool for criminal investigation. This has raised many concerns in civil society, since governments and companies could interfere with fundamental rights of the people &#8211;like privacy, due process, etc- in order to get successful outcomes.  In this sense, the most challenging aspect for all countries on this subject is the harmonization of their rules on criminal procedure and investigation techniques. 
	The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime &#8211;drawn up by Council of Europe- has been the only document to generate a certain level of harmonization on the matter, to the point that it has been ratified by countries outside Europe. In this respect, many Latin-American countries joined the Convention or expressed their desire to do so. This move was presented as a mean to provide a legal framework to investigation techniques that are currently being implemented by security forces without rules to comply with.
	It&#180;s necessary to adopt strong safeguards and analyze if the Convention is really a move forward towards the right direction or whether there are still some weakness in its provisions that need to be amended from a human rights and rule of law perspective.  This way, this session will  create a space of dialogue among civil society organizations from Europe and Latin America to review the Budapest Convention and the adoption of a possible Second Protocol to the Convention. The goal is to share ideas and experiences based on cases, legislation or practices from both regions and brainstorm about a suggested way forward.
anyone who is interested or wants to share its experience in how investigations using electronic data can put in danger our rights to privacy, personal data protection and freedom of expression. We expect to seize this opportunity to trigger the conversation between European organizations &#8211;who have many years dealing with the Convention- and  Latin-American organizations &#8211;who are beginning to address this subject- in order to gain more knowledge, more insights and establish interregional alliances, with the aim to improve the influence of civil society in the making of public policies on cross-border access to data.

An election&#8217;s success depends on transparent and accountable protection and promotion of these rights. As voting and identification procedures become digitized, technology is increasingly inextricable &#8211; and influential &#8211; during elections, in ways that authorities have yet to address. 
While modern computing methods, in particular cloud-based machine learning, which is fuelled by  big data technology, constitute a paradigm shift in how we interact and communicate and enhance the protection of human rights, their role in undermining human rights has been under spotlight, especially in the conduct of elections. Some of the challenges include the use of social media for propaganda and questions around the integrity of electronic voting, as we saw in Kenya. The misuse of technology has negatively impacted on the freedom to participate in the political process. Yet, the same technologies that potentially threaten rights also provide opportunities for their enhanced protection. For example, social media has been used to provide information to voters vital for them to make informed choices. 
Drawing on the wide range of interdisciplinary panellists, the panel will consider both the opportunities for the enhanced protection of human rights by technologies, the threats they pose and approaches that need to be adapted to meet the rapidly evolving technological landscape. The panel will discuss:
Safeguards in the use of election biometric technologies as Kenya and a number of African countries are adopting such technologies. 
Computational Propaganda, Algorithms-based Misinformation, Intermediaries
Measuring Technical based censorship and Technical Countermeasures 
Social Media, Civic Space, Off and Online Freedom of Expression. 
Hackers such as Hackers Without Borders, Academia such as Citizen Lab, African Researchers and Advocate and those funding them like HIVOS, Ford Foundation, OTF, those working on elections in other regions of the world. A nuanced understanding of the problem of technology and big data and impact on elections and democratic processes.
Whether fundamental human rights concepts and approaches need to be adapted to meet the rapidly evolving technological landscape.
How to architect human rights considerations in election technology design. 

How to embed non-technological safeguards in tech-based elections, such as paper trail for verifiability. 
a fundamental re-assessment of the theory and practice of human rights and will advance approaches to regulation in a constantly changing technological world. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/27</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="100">Arthur Gwagwa</person></persons></event><event id="101"><date>2018-03-06T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>La Factoria</duration><track>Making Better Tech</track><abstract /><title>Everything&#8217;s on fire, here&#8217;s how we&#8217;re trying to put it out</title><description>Security is hard. Defending systems and infrastructure we rely on every day from attacks is hard. How to secure networks is an integral yet often neglected part of cyber security policy discussions. If, as a society, we are to have a hope of protecting both our privacy and our security when using technology, networks must be secure by default, from the start.

 As an NGO we face challenges in the same way as any small or medium sized enterprise (SME) when it comes to technology. But tech knowledge is expensive, hard to find, and until recently was not even considered in funding models. At PI, our internal systems were often left unmaintained, unpatched and bordering on insecure. This highlighted the need to examine our organisational security as a whole, particularly defending our network from attacks and data loss. If an organisation&#8217;s network is insecure, ransomware or a hack can spread through an organisation, causing untold damage, as demonstrated in the recent Wannacry and NotPetya attacks.

 Technologists at Privacy International have developed Thornsec, a piece of open source software which is an automated way to deploy, test, and audit internal and external services for an organisation, saving a lot of time and creating a sustainable security model. We are using this software to run all of Privacy International&#8217;s services &#8211; website, calendar, project management tools, Tor hidden services, VPNs. Thornsec is not solely a technological initiative, it is also changing the culture of the organisation by increasing our understanding of network security and making us all pay more attention to the technology we take for granted every day.


 PI would like to share our experience and lessons learned of failing, tearing apart our services and rebuilding our organisational network from scratch.Members of the community and managers of organisations that want to learn more about organisational security; those that have an interest in understanding network security. Aim to broaden the digital security debate from a focus on individual digital security to organisational/network security.

 Organisations are interested in knowing more about Thornsec, possibly even trialing it.

providing a way to look up IP addresses from domain names (and other
secondary features).  Unfortunately, it is not designed by default
with privacy in mind.  That means that when activists, dissidents,
journalists, whistleblowers, or anyone looks up a domain name, they're
usually leaking that name to their network operator, providing a
simple path for easy metadata collection and analysis of their
intended traffic.

For example, the network gets to see who is looking up
"refugeerights.example", "abortionservices.example", or
"blacklivesmatter.example", even if the network services hosted by all
of those domains are fully-encrypted.

Fortunately, in the last year we've managed to standardize simple
basic privacy protections for the DNS, and there's relatively easy
software to deploy on the server side.  But we need DNS recursive
resolver operators who are dedicated to user privacy to ensure that
the privacy protections are meaningful.  (We'll cover the
architectural details for why this is important in the session)

This session will describe the basic privacy protections offered by
DNS-over-TLS, their limitations, and how DNS-over-TLS servers can be
deployed and supported.

There are still a few missing pieces of the puzzle, including
widespread easy client-side support.  We'll discuss what's needed
there, and work on ways to complete the gaps.This session is for network service operators who want to provide
public-facing DNS resolvers that can help users avoid tracking by the
DNS.  We'll cover a couple options for DNS recursive resolver
software, how to install and maintain them, and how to provide simple
instructions so that users can take advantage of this privacy feature.

If you control a system in which you can spin up a private virtual
machine with a public IP address to host an new service
experimentally, you should join this session!

Having more well-known public service operators should also spur the
development wider client-side support across a range of operating
systems.  We'll walk through some standard configurations, and
document feature requests for tools that should be improved to set up
this sort of service by default.
By the end of the session, we'd like to have several more DNS privacy
servers running on the public internet.

Depending on the capabilities of the devices people bring to this
session, some people should be able to leave the session using private
DNS to one of the existing DNS privacy servers.

We'd also like to have feature requests / bug reports filed against
client side software that needs improvement in support.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/614</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="102">Daniel Kahn Gillmor</person></persons></event><event id="103"><date>2018-03-06T14:30:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>La Factoria</duration><track>Making Better Tech</track><abstract /><title>Fixing the internet: DHCP chapter</title><description>(Presentation, QA, workshop.)

Improvements to DHCP to reduce tracking in public spaces

DHCP is a protocol that allows a device to obtain configuration settings from the network it connects to. But it also transmits identifying information that can be used to track individuals and the devices they use.
In this workshop we will install DHCP clients that minimize disclosure of linkable identifiers.

Yet many people we care about, continue to have blas&#233; attitude towards privacy. Whenever there is an option of price and convenience over privacy, many people invariably choose the former. How can we help people understand the consequences of giving-up privacy for convenience? 

We&#8217;ll host a conversation about how to educate people &#8216;why privacy matters&#8217; and to better understand the &#8216;privacy&#8217; they are surrendering when they choose convenient or no-cost tools. We will share specific limitations to a tech-first approach to communicating security benefits and discuss better alternatives. Examining language on websites, app store description, and in app, we identify ways to clearly communicate how software works, improving transparency for both technical and non-technical users.

We will discuss ways to promote the belief that individual security and privacy on the internet is fundamental and brainstorm ideas about how to make people we interact with, aware about the effect of casual or indifferent attitude towards privacy rights. This session is for anyone who values privacy and needs to convince others that they should, too, like Journalists, Software Developers, Security Trainers, Designers, Advocacy/Policy Professionals, Communications Professionals, Academics and Front Line Activists.We would like for us to all feel better prepared to communicate the value of privacy beyond our normal circles. We will produce notes and suggestions that can be used by any technical project in this space. And perhaps have some collective action items for the community.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/300</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="105">Liz Steininger</person></persons></event><event id="106"><date>2018-03-06T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Flyover Front</duration><track>On the Frontlines</track><abstract /><title>Ciudadano pol&#237;tico: puedes y debes hacer pol&#237;tica</title><description>It will be a presentation of the Ciudadano Pol&#237;tico investigation project.

The members of the International Telecommunication Union did not share a common position on digital sovereignty. Russia, the CIS countries, China, the Middle East and Latin America countries, voted to define the digital boundaries of each country in the network, which led to the emergence of a number of national  restricting laws for Internet regulation. 

Arguments for digital sovereignty are as follows:
- extreme measures in the context of information warfare
- confrontation with the United States, which has monopolized the Internet, and has become threat to national sovereignty
- fight against international terrorism
- child protection
- protection of the national output and the economy of the country

Characteristics of countries aimed at achieving full digital sovereignty:
requiring the localization of IT-business (opening a representative office, transferring the servers);
taxing foreign companies providing services to citizens (VAT, income tax);
posing non-tariff barriers to trade
restricting access to certain foreign websites and entire platforms;
setting up a clear system of cross-border traffic transfer;
supporting national firewalls;
requiring all major international companies to cooperate with national law enforcement agencies directly;
having own ideological and content policy for citizens
creating own (or duplicating) critical infrastructure and developing intranets;
declaring course on equipment and content import substitution 
declaring cryptocurrency a monetary surrogate and prohibiting free circulation of block-tokens;

We would like to discuss the toxic effect of digital sovereignty and how it influens on digital rights of netizens. this session is for the advocates, lawyers and digital rights activists We would like to get answers for some questions:
- Can the attempt of the state authorities of different countries to create jurisdictional borders in the network and determine the digital sovereignty be explained or is the necessity of these borders just an excuse for repressive regimes?

- What are the side effects of digital sovereignty? How does digital sovereignty affect human rights?
- Can the course chosen by the post-Soviet states isolate them from the Western Internet?
- Why is the Internet regulated by the principles formed during the age of telegraph, telephone and radio? Isn&#8217;t it the time to start making changes?
- Do we need to set up a new international digital convention presented by codified international standards and the online playing field and how should we do it?</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/400</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="107">Sarkis Darbinyan</person></persons></event><event id="108"><date>2018-03-06T14:30:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Flyover Front</duration><track>Training and Best Practices</track><abstract /><title>Changes and challenges, scary but necessary.

However, activists and netizens still face challenges and difficulties as they push the political boundaries online and offline, particularly from the state. The Vietnamese government continually monitors and often intermittently blocks certain sites during periods of political activity. Activists are also followed and threatened by state-sponsored thugs.

There are no dissidents or activists who are active inside the country, since all opposition is brutally cracked down and punished.  

Mr. Jung Gwang Il, Founder &amp; Executive Director of No Chain, building upon the successful presentation given at the 2017 IFF that garnered great turnout and interest, will update IFF attendees on what No Chain has undertaken in the last year to bring the Internet to the North Korean people.  

Specifically, No Chain has purchased smart phones with apps pre-loaded on the phones, which have been sent into North Korea, and most importantly, Wi-Fi routers and range extenders (which broadcast the signals up to 2.5 kilometers, which covers North Korea along the China/NK border area) that are positioned on the China side of the border.  The Wi-Fi routers are turned on 24 hours a day, allowing people in North Korea with No Chain-provided smart phones, to access the Internet.

Mr. Jung will also introduce a new method of sending outside information into North Korea that No Chain has recently started, via plastic water bottles filled with rice and USBs containing outside content (such as South Korean dramas and western movies) and most importantly, an off-line version of the Korean language Wikipedia, that are launched from the west coast of South Korea and sent to North Korea using the ocean currents of the Yellow Sea.

Finally, Mr. Jung will mention the other ongoing projects regarding the information dissemination work done by No Chain &#8211; the only North Korea defector-founded and led human rights NGO that is using the Air (via drones), Land (via the border area), and the Sea (water bottles with rice and USBs) to bring the information revolution to the people of North Korea.  Mr. Jung also looks forward to sharing his ideas, and most importantly, hearing from the experts and other activists/dissidents attending IFF 2018, on how to collaborate and share ideas and methods in bringing freedom of information for the people of North Korea.  For EVERYONE - anyone with an interest in freedom of information, and with ideas on how to give Internet access to the people of North Korea - the most closed off country in the world - tech experts, dissidents from other countries, journalists, etc.  North Korea would be the only country/issue represented at IFF 2018 where the Internet is completely blocked off to the people living inside the country.  
The tech experts and innovators would benefit the most, because North Korea presents such a challenge, yet an opportunity - in how to provide Internet access to the people, without going through the Kim Jong Un regime.  We would like to gain technical knowledge and help, as well as NEW ideas and methods in providing the Internet and outside information to the people inside North Korea.  
IFF 2018 would be the perfect gathering place for Mr. Jung and No Chain to gain that kind of help, advice, and technical knowledge.  </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/672</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="117">HenrySong</person></persons></event><event id="118"><date>2018-03-06T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Theater</duration><track>On the Frontlines</track><abstract /><title>Cambodia shut down</title><description>A discussion on the current situation for human rights defenders, journalists and activists in Cambodia, based on the personal experience of one Cambodian human rights defender.

The first target is multidisciplinary: activists doing any form of progressive/radical advocacy, which looks for spread content outside the mainstream debate. With a technical tool, we are studying how the algorithm personalization plays against.

This frame helps to understand why the algorithm hegemony has actual effects even if you consider social media as the necessary evil tool you need for a political campaign.

The second target is more the technopolitical one: how the collectivity of the Internet users can mobilize and react against a monopoly? How can we judge if an algorithm, invisible but necessary, is it fair or now? Speaker's utopia is a world in which person could configure their algorithm, compose it, remix it, sell it and decide their values. 

We will show some practical tool and tactics to assess the content spreading.

This checklist is designed to streamline the process of user research, promote human-rights-centered design, and aid builders of tools, platforms, and services with limited resources and time. 

Whether you are building a platform to help vulnerable communities or providing people with resources for direct tech interventions, it is challenging to ensure the product or service is adaptive to the needs of whose privacy and safety we want to protect. In light of this, we shared our experiences and reviewed best practices in the field to create a checklist with our suggestions conducting research/design to defend human rights online.  

Our focus in this session is on interaction and engagement. The session format will be a group-based discussion, to allow flexibility with varying numbers of participants. We would start by learning about the participants&#8217; backgrounds (10mins, time permitting), followed by a brief introduction to the checklist (15mins). Afterwards, we would break up into small groups, depending on the size of participation, with a series of questions to discuss (60mins). The session will wrap up with bullet points of outcomes and insights share by each group (35mins). We will document the whole process and share reflections at the conclusion of the session.Technologists, UX designers and researchers, activists, journalists, digital rights defendersIn this session we aim to share our initial checklist, gather feedback from session participants, and learn from others seeking to adopt and standardize usability best practices for the next stage of development. To make the checklist as widely applicable as possible, we will encourage participants to draw upon their previous practices and projects and share their experiences and suggestions. With this unique opportunity to connect with like-minded groups at IFF, we also look forward to ways we can collaborate and build on related projects.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/173</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="126">Natalie Cadranel</person></persons></event></room><room name="Gallery"><event id="127"><date>2018-03-09T12:15:00</date><start>12:15</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Gallery</duration><track>Advocacy, Policy and Research</track><abstract /><title>Using research in digital rights advocacy: a conversation on the research needs of the community</title><description>This session follows up on the discussion we led at the 2017 IFF on collaborations between academics, researchers, technologists, and activist organizations and designing &#8220;research for impact&#8221;. At that session, attendees had many ideas about what was needed for the community in terms of research, how to better facilitate collaborations across a variety of fields, and the ways in which funding can be structured to encourage impactful research. Our team at the Internet Policy Observatory sought to build on this feedback and systematically gather insights from a wide range of digital rights-focused organizations over the past year. At the 2018 IFF, we are launching our report on the research needs of the Internet Freedom community, an analysis of the responses of over 50 digital rights advocacy organizations from across the world  to questions on how these organizations utilize research within their advocacy, the types of research methods they employ, the factors that enable collaboration between academics and practitioners, and research topics or datasets that respondents believe would be useful in their work but do not yet exist. The purpose of the conversation at the IFF is to share these perceptions of research related to internet freedom, to discuss the international and regional trends and disparities, to promote research areas that have been unexplored and under-funded, and to develop ideas for collaborative research projects between academics, advocacy organizations, and policymakers. Researchers, Activists, funders of research/advocacy, technologistsFeedback on the report as well as a possible V2 of the report based on the conversations and insight from the group participating. Potentially, a document specifically meant for an audience of funding organizations suggesting strategies for funding collaborative research opportunities and signed/endorsed by those in the IF community.

The Framework outlines nine separate principles critical for an open and democratic internet, and contextualizes them through on-the-ground examples, warning signs to look for, and links to related international frameworks and standards.

Documents on their own do nothing. Now that the Framework has been published, how can it - as well as other sets of principles related to internet freedom - realistically assist activists and advocates to push against forces at the local or international level who threaten an open internet? How can we make such norms and standards documents and approaches accessible to those new to the digital rights space? Is their use and promotion actually an effective way to create policy-level change in the internet freedom space? 

This conversation session will introduce the Democratic Framework, and invite others to share their own experiences with operationalizing or using international norms and standards for advocacy. The session is targeted at a wide and diverse set of stakeholders - from local activists to internet freedom policy experts, particularly those who have worked on developing, implementing, or even criticizing other open internet/internet freedom frameworks and principles to discuss these questions and share their own experiences. - Peer learning - especially from those working in repressive and closed spaces - about their experiences in using and implementing other Internet Freedom and/or Open Internet principles and frameworks. What has worked well, what hasn&#8217;t? 
- Feedback on the Framework itself - does it resonate with the IFF community? Are there gaps? 
- Raise awareness of NDI, CIPE, and CIMA&#8217;s Open Internet Fellowship program, to be launched in late Spring 2018 and targeted towards local activists.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/583</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="128">Sarah Moulton</person></persons></event><event id="129"><date>2018-03-09T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Gallery</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>Much harsher internet landscape in China</title><description>We've seen the recent crack down on VPN and shadowsocks during 19th people's Congress.

Can creativity hack the hate? 

While female and gender non-conformative voices become more vocal in the web, sexist, misogynous, homophobic and racist attacks using online platforms to silence these voices also rise exponentially and, apparently, well organized. Solutions to tackle this problem varies from pushing for policy changes within these platforms and law enforcement agencies, to organizing support lines and collective responses within networks of solidarity. 

According to the local context, some approaches seem more feasible then others. And if you are a feminist activist from far away of the Silicon Valley and with law enforcement agents that are just as sexist as your attackers, creative usages of our networks of solidarities seems to be the most effective. 

We do believe creativity can serve us Kung Fu, which uses the opponents owns energy to neutralize it or even empower our own moves. While this approach has been common to women's strategies to defeat harassment offline, we still have a lot to explore transposing these tactics to the online environments. So, how can we do it?  Can we have queer feminist bots to help us deliver counter speech? Can we use games to come up with innovative approaches to mitigate online harassment? How do we exponentiate responses using the network that already exists?

This workshop will feed on the methodology that has been developed in a meeting held in Chile (November 2017) that put together a network of feminists from different backgrounds: artists, grass roots activists and digital rights advocates/trainers. We will also briefly showcase the outcomes of that meeting for inputs/possibility to localize it in other regions, etc.  -If you are a feminist or work with gender perspective on internet issues, in this session you will find the perfect place to brainstorming creative ideas and organize resistance to misogyny, homophobia and hate speech.
 -If you like arts and any form of creativity, in this session you will find a place to imagine and design concrete tools of resistance.
 - If you work with technology and you are fed-up with hate on the internet, in this session you will find a safe place to think on concrete technology solutions as means of liberation- we will present our projects to hack hate and we will add the fabulous community feedback/analyse possibilities to localize it for other contexts, etc
- we will come up with a series of ideas for creative responses and analyse the possibility to implement them across our networks

In most countries, laws are in place or in the making which curtail freedom of expression &#8211; in the name of national security and territorial integrity, or in order to prevent public disorder and combat crime. In repressive societies, the chill on free speech is absolute, with journalists and artists threatened or killed and political dissidents disappearing in suspicious circumstances. But even in more democratic societies, polarization in society has led to growing numbers of people holding a view that can be summarised as: &#8216;you should be able to say what you like, but only as long as you agree with me&#8217;. Even though technology facilitates freedom of expression in authoritarian countries, it can also easily be used to censor information of public interest, expand surveillance and attack critical Internet users. 
This session will focus on the new frontiers defining freedom of expression in the 21st century. These are young frontrunners: artists, musicians, hacktivists, vloggers, activists, etc. As digital natives, they explore and appropriate opportunities to develop new cultural and media content, thus contributing to a more thriving and dynamic cultural and media sector, engaging new audiences and contributing to diversification of dialogue, debate and dissent in society. The conversation will be based on research findings from East Africa, Southern Africa and the Mena region that explore the extent and how individuals and communities in arts, culture, design,  etc are using digital technologies to examine and criticize existing hegemonic structures in society (such as authoritarian regimes, neoliberalism, heteronormativity etc), in order to contribute to a more open environment where people can freely express themselves.

We will start by inviting people to create characters and to participate in the session problematizing the possibility of have multiply identities on the Internet environment. Then, from the memory and experience of the participants, we will build a time line of the history of the Internet and its spaces, from BBS to Facebook, and we will start a conversation about the different identities that the Internet had, and how we experience identity construction in each of its spaces.

We understand that the way we inhabit these spaces influences how we shape our identity. And we believe that the idea of Internet Freedom is directly connected to the discussions about the increasingly restriction of the experience of identity multiplicity online (Facebook's real name policy, for example).

We started thinking about it from the digital security point of view: management of identities as a security tactic. But the subject expanded, took other directions, became more politicized. The possibility of creating fictions and acting from them and experience being someone else is an act of resistance! Most Internet services want to centralize our identity, make it unique, measurable, quantifiable, salable. But we are multiple, we perform identities every day in offline spaces (with family and friends). To exercise the ability to have multiple identities online is an experience of otherness. It creates empathy (instead of hate) towards people who are different from ourselves. So it is not only a tactic to mitigate surveillance and violation of privacy, but also a form of anti-hegemonic and anti-capitalist resistance.

Thus, the guiding questions of the session are:
- What does it mean to be another, to be many or to be a monster on the Internet today? And how can we do that? What impacts would it bring to our lives and the life of the Internet?
- What is the relationship between multiple identities, privacy and Internet freedom?
Session Methodology:
Step 1: What clothes should I wear?
Goal: 
Perform warm-up activity in which participants are invited to build another personality so that we can problematize the possibility of being other people in the internet environment.
Material: 
Noel Rosa's music "Com que roupa eu vou?", Costumes, makeup, props.
How to: 
Receive the workshop participants with the music playing in the background, explain that to inhabit that space they need to invent a new personality. Be another. Encourage them to use one or more props arranged on a table.
Time: 15min

Step 2: "What is the identity of the Internet?"
Goal:
Create a panel "time line" with the group of the history of the Internet and its spaces, from BBS to Facebook, and make a conversation about the different identities that the Internet had, and how we experience identity construction in each of its spaces.
Material:
Kraft paper, pens, post-its, tapes.
How to: :
Talk a little about how people are feeling with the props, and start the problematization about being many and being others on the internet. Check with the group if they notice a transformation on the Internet regarding the ways we perform our identities online. Start making the panel by asking how  social networks, chat rooms and services were when the Internet came up. 
Activists, researchers, developers, designers and the whole Internet Freedom CommunityActivate a network of people and organizations interested in jointly reflecting about the consequence of using online services that want to centralize our identity and make it measurable, quantifiable, salable

This panel will seek to answer this important question by examining issues that have emerged with the lack of intermediation for youth going online in Southeast Asia. In addition to the global concerns of cyber crime, bullying and &#8216;fake news,&#8217; the rapid spread of social media among youth in Southeast Asia has seen problems ranging from religious and nationalist extremism to entrapment by human traffickers. The panelists, experienced activists from the region, are on the front lines of understanding social media trends in their respective nations, and devising civil society responses to the emerging challenges. 

Specific issues to be addressed:
Myanmar -- the rise of Buddhist nationalism online

Over the past 7 years, the tech industry has developed new tactics and tools to protect corporations against the APT threat.  There are now networks of companies sharing information, new tools to protect networks, and new trainings for analysts. 

Although less covered by mainstream media, we have now consistent evidence that these same attacks are used by malicious actors around the world to target activists, journalists, and civil society organizations.  Unfortunately, the resources and tools developed by the tech industry are often not available for non-profit organization either because of lack of budget, or because assumptions regarding corporations do not hold true for civil society.

In this session, we will present new detection tools, which we are designing, building, or using to improve security in civil society organisations.  Detection tools are tools designed to detect evidence of digital attacks, and perform some action.  In the case of known attacks, the tool blocks the attack.  In the case of suspicious or odd messages or behavior, the tool may alert the user so they can perform some context-appropriate action, or the tool may alert researchers if further technical study is warranted.

In the first part of the session, we will present the idea of detection tools, and describe the following tools:


Blockade: Blockade is a browser extension that automatically downloads a list of malicious domains (e.g., domains used in phishing or malware attacks targeted against civil society) and blocks any request to these domains.  Both the extension and server-side code are open-source and easy to use.


GScan : GScan is a browser extension that scans a Gmail mailbox for certain indicators that the message may be malicious. If a suspicious email is identified, GScan will alert the user, and ask the user&#8217;s consent before sending the email to researchers for further technical analysis.


Himaya : Himaya is a server-side email scanner which does in-depth scanning of emails -- both past emails and new emails as they are received -- including opening some links, and executing some attachments in a sandbox.  If the email matches known malicious behavior or indicators, the user will be alerted.  In other cases, researchers may be alerted that an email needs further technical analysis before a determination can be made.

The second part of this session will be a conversation with the audience on how to improve civil society protection against malware operations, with the following questions as a starting point :


What role should detection tools play in addressing digital insecurity caused by malware and phishing?  How do these tools fit in with other tools (e.g., secure communication tools, password managers, secure workstations), and also with training?


What is the right model for designing, developing, deploying, and sustaining detection tools over time?  For this point, we hope to draw on IFF attendees with previous expertise in building and supporting tools.


Are there any other pressing civil society needs regarding detection that our tools do not cover?  What other tools and solutions would be interesting for the community?

The main objectives of the discussion are to: (1) discover how the detection tools we are working on, and tools in general, can better meet the diverse needs of the activist community, (2) serve as a forum to link activists and technologists to start discussions and collaborations centered around tools that continue after IFF.
Members of civil society organizations concerned about digital security and members of the community who have experiences developing, using or sustaining toolsWe would like this session to serve as a forum to link activists and technologists to start discussions and collaborations centered around tools that continue after IFF.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/138</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="138">Etienne</person></persons></event><event id="139"><date>2018-03-09T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Theater</duration><track>Advocacy, Policy and Research</track><abstract /><title>Lessons learned from localizing corporate accountability research</title><description>Internet, mobile, and telecommunications companies play a significant role in our day-to-day lives, and the rules that these platforms create directly impact how we are able to exercise our human rights. However, these policies are often unclear or not public, leaving users in the dark about to what extent--or even if--their rights are being respected. To begin to address this knowledge gap, Ranking Digital Rights produces a Corporate Accountability Index that evaluates 22 of the world&#8217;s leading internet, mobile, and telecommunications companies on their public disclosure of policies and practices that affect users&#8217; freedom of expression and privacy. Researchers from different parts of the world have also adapted RDR&#8217;s methodology to conduct their own research projects evaluating companies in their own national and regional contexts. In this session, several of these researchers will give a brief overview of their work, share lessons learned from their experience conducting localized research, and provide tips for those interested in conducting similar research. In addition to learning more about these projects, and how others can conduct similar research in their countries and regions, we will also engage all session attendees in a broader conversation to identify avenues for future collaboration and brainstorm advocacy strategies.This session is for anyone interested in how internet, mobile, and telecommunications companies impact individuals&#8217; freedom of expression and privacy rights, and especially for those working on or interested in company-directed research and advocacy.Participants will learn more about the Corporate Accountability Index and other research projects examining company policies around various freedom of expression and privacy issues. Participants will also be able to brainstorm advocacy strategies and identify areas for future collaboration and research.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/539</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="139">Ilana Ullman</person></persons></event><event id="140"><date>2018-03-09T17:00:00</date><start>17:00</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Theater</duration><track>Journalism, Media and Communications</track><abstract /><title>Surveillance fascism in Bahrain: the secret political economy of surveillance technologies and their impact on journalists and activists</title><description>The use of spyware and malware against journalists and activists is increasing in many countries around the world as states strive to control information and as technologies to surveil civilians become more sophisticated, inexpensive, and successful. This confluence of factors is creating a new reality for activists and journalists in many countries globally as they seek to express themselves and their ideas online. The creation and selling of sophisticated surveillance systems by companies in western democracies to authoritarian regimes further facilitates this asymmetrical power dynamic between states and their citizens. Yet, little academic attention has examined the political economy of surveillance technologies, which are often created in democratic countries and used to suppress dissent in non-democratic countries. This paper will utilize the case study of Bahrain to compare the companies, products, and buyers who create, sell, or buy surveillance technologies and show how these surveillance technologies have been used by governments to target activists and journalists. It will argue that the close cooperation between the state and corporations in the development and selling of surveillance technologies, contributes to what I call surveillance fascism. The examples and findings will shed light on the shrouded political economy of surveillance technologies and export control agreements which seek to regulate these technologies, and the implications these technologies have on democratic values and human rights. journalists, technologists, NGOs, academics, policy wonksGreater awareness and understanding about the political economy of surveillance technologies and how these harm journalists and activists.</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/422</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="140">Jenn</person></persons></event></room><room name="Think Tank"><event id="141"><date>2018-03-09T14:30:00</date><start>14:30</start><duration>2:00</duration><duration>Think Tank</duration><track>Training and Best Practices</track><abstract /><title>Anonymity and privacy using Tails</title><description>Introduce the concepts of anonymity, privacy, and metadata using TAILS live operative system.

But the incursion of this technology into the State level has been anything but friendly to fundamental human rights.

Throughout Latin America, several countries are working on the implementation and even the development and production of aerial surveillance technologies, with applications ranging from the monitoring of protests and social mobilizations, to the assistance in judicial searches and border surveillance. Law Enforcement Agencies and Armed Forces are beginning to use drones and surveillance balloons without first carrying out an impact analysis on the human rights of the population and without proper legal frameworks that allow adequate accountability and control over the personal data of the individuals subject to such surveillance. The lack of legal frameworks around video surveillance has allowed LEAs and other State agencies to venture in this activities, putting courts in a position to decide public policy issues that should be democratically discussed and addressed.

As the implementation of technology advances in our day to day lives, it has become increasingly difficult to identify every aspect of it that may pose a threat to our human rights and individual liberties. One of the main challenge that the implementation of drones and other surveillance technologies presents, is that it necessarily makes the discussion more complex, making it harder to raise awareness about the need for high accountability standards on the use of such technologies, as it's easy for individuals to fall into the "nothing to hide, nothing to fear" narrative trap that we aim to challenge.

The work that Derechos Digitales has been carrying out in Chile, with the litigation of the implementation of surveillance balloons in the country's capital, and ADC in Argentina, with research on the use of drones and surveillance balloons by police and other LEAs, as well as the production of drones by the military, will lay the grounds of the conversation in order to work in the development of arguments and strategies of awareness raising for this issue.

This session will serve as the space to think collectively how to face the implementation and expansion of the use of surveillance technologies, not only in Latin America, but in different regions and countries around the world where participants come from. The main question that we are going to address is: How to raise awareness about the state's use of drones (and related surveillance technologies) and the imminent violation of fundamental rights? To answer this question we will take into account the field of expertise of each participant (tech, communications, design, media, policy, etc).
Anyone interested in how drones and surveillance technologies impact their fundamental rights and day to day life, want to learn more about this issue and/or want to share their own experiences, knowledge and how they are facing it in their local contexts.Arguments and strategies that different actors (civil society, designers, media/journalists, etc) can use to engage in their own contexts challenging the implementation of these technologies.

How do different global groups support each other (emotionally, digitally, and beyond)? What are the best ways to make strong security (on and offline) a habit, when activists are running on extremely low bandwidth with a limited understanding of the risks? When crisis-mode kicks in, use of tools is simply not on the priority list. This conversation will be an opportunity for organizers to share stories, and for all to collaborate together to think deeply about the limitations, the threats, and the opportunities amidst tense organizing environments. 

Those in the space know about the threats, but the stories from the ground and the frontlines help us put into perspective what is truly holding us back and causing information leaks that sometimes lead to arrests. We have to stay grounded in the stories in order to realistically strengthen the health of our networks and organizations.

1. Introductions to different open source tools used to analyse various malware. (target platform: Ubuntu.  And if time permit us, we will develop our own malware and play around with it (of course, for educational purpose only))
2. Hands-on (Dissecting malware and perform Static and Dynamic Analysis  - we will play with few well-known malwares and trace its Command and Control Server)
3. Mitigate the threat
4. Generating Reports 
5. Recommend Best Practices 
6. Follow up (collaboration may be?)I would like to see all the tech-staff of different Organizations to be in this room (Especially those who want to collect malware as evidence of crackdown in the digital world). I am quite certain that the session will benefit all of us and most importantly, I would like to connect with you all so that we can collaborate as a team in the near future. 
If you are non-tech enthusiasts, don't worry at all. The session will be a  beginner friendly one! But I must admit that it will be a learning session, and who knows you might lose few calories at the end of the session, which I believe it is a good one :-)
Meanwhile, I will bring some juicy stuff so that, tech people won't get bored while the beginners work at their own pace :-) 
It won't be a realistic approach if I expect too much from this 2 hours session yet 
1. After this session, I want all the participants be knowledgeable enough to not to mess with the forensic evidence.
2. Capture the memory snap-shot, without tampering the real data.
3. Perform analysis (on your own virtual machine)
4. Know how to share what information and what not to. (with others)
5. (Most important) Spirit of collaboration!
6. I will bring case stories of Malware being used to crack down on activist and freedom of speech on the digital platform by state and others. 
Through this, I hope all the activists will come to know, not just photo and video can be an evidence of exploitation but through the digital forensics, we can prove to the international community about the dire situation. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/365</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="146">Samdup</person></persons></event><event id="147"><date>2018-03-09T09:45:00</date><start>09:45</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>Visual Room</duration><track>Journalism, Media and Communications</track><abstract /><title>Fight misinformation: How to verify photos and videos</title><description>In this interactive training session, we'll cover and practice basic steps in verifying and checking images, videos, links and claims shared via social networks.

We also don&#8217;t have right to freedom of speech. Investments for surveillance technologies, secret meetings with internet companies, ignorance of law, internet throttling, blocked and censored web pages over 120.000, government control over main stream media&#8230; These things show how Turkey ignore human rights. Reaching to true news/informations is only possible online, but disinformation is so common and financed by government. Another danger in Turkey is self-censorship. Communication right is one of the most important element of freedom of speech and human rights. Eventhough communication rights are constitutional, so many people are jailed for sharing their ideas on internet.

So, what to do? We have groups and NGOs that uphold freedoms but Internet freedom is an international/global issue so struggle must be also international. While free communication space are still accessible, for decentralisation of internet, to get rid of digital enclosure, to put the pressure regions like Turkey that restricting freedom, we have to provide international collaboration. To start mesh internet , to report unlawful practices, to defend privacy and right to digital security for citizens, network neutrality and right to be forgotten are our priority. We want to discuss common issues on the basis of Turkey and create common solutions with who are participate to this session at IFF.  Frontline activists, journalists, communications professionals, NGO representativesWe want to define 3 basic issues (like surveillance, censorship, law etc.)  with participants and see what is happening regional and global. Then talk about solutions and create networks to fight this issues together. </description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/396</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="149">sevketuy</person></persons></event><event id="150"><date>2018-03-09T12:15:00</date><start>12:15</start><duration>1:00</duration><duration>La Factoria</duration><track>Advocacy, Policy and Research</track><abstract /><title>Promoting children's right to online privacy in Zimbabwe/ low income countries</title><description>This is a conversation based session on the protection of children's right to online privacy in Zimbabwe and other similar low income countries.
The main reason for this session is to provide a platform to discuss and evaluate the need for mechanisms which protect children's privacy online. Zimbabwe has a general privacy protection clause in its Constitution, there is no supporting legislation on how to implement those constitutional provisions. I also respectfully submit that this general protection of privacy does not adequately cover the unique privacy needs of children and other traditionally marginalised groups such as sexual minorities and women. That is why there is need for discussions of this nature; discussions which promote and advocate for the protection of each marginalised demographics&#8217; privacy.
The session will start off with a discussion on the dangers children face online and how other countries and jurisdictions have dealt with these potential dangers. Participants attending this session would therefore, be encouraged to bring and share experiences on this topic from their own countries.
The session would also include an informal brainstorming exercise meant to identify or strategise on practical steps which can be taken to lobby for the development or drafting of the requisite policies and legislation necessary to protect and promote children's right to privacy.
There will also be an opportunity to discuss the various applicable tools which can be used in the protection and promotion of children&#8217;s right to privacy.Generally, this session is for anyone interested in protecting and promoting the right to privacy online. 
The session would also be of interest to child rights defenders, privacy advocates, policy makers and policy researchers, designers of circumvention tools, and information security specialists.The session outcomes are:
- the need to protect children's online privacy is established and justified
- the problems/challenges in protecting children's online privacy especially in low income countries are mapped
- comparative notes are exchanged on how other Governments and policy makers promote and protect children's online privacy
- formulation of draft advocacy strategies which seek to encourage the development of similar policies in Zimbabwe
- it is established which circumvention tools can be used by Internet users to promote and protect children's online privacy</description><type /><conf_url>https://platform.internetfreedomfestival.org/en/IFF2018/public/schedule/custom/228</conf_url><full_conf_url /><released /><persons><person id="150">Kuda</person></persons></event><event id="151"><date>2018-03-09T23:00:00</date><start>23:00</start><duration>-1 day, 13:00</duration><duration>La Factoria</duration><track>Internet Freedom: Present and Future</track><abstract /><title>Balancing digital rights against counter terrorism - a case study of Pakistan</title><description>In Pakistan, terrorism is the biggest security concern of the government, thanks to the homegrown and cross border terrorism from Afghanistan.
